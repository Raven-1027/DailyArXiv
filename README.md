| **[Real-is-Sim: Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap with a Dynamic Digital Twin for Real-World Robot Policy Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03597v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in behavior cloning have enabled robots to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, accurately assessing training performance remains challenging, particularly for real-world applications, as behavior cloning losses often correlate poorly with actual task success. Consequently, researchers resort to success rate metrics derived from costly and time-consuming real-world evaluations, making the identification of optimal policies and detection of overfitting or underfitting impractical. To address these issues, we propose real-is-sim, a novel behavior cloning framework that incorporates a dynamic digital twin (based on Embodied Gaussians) throughout the entire policy development pipeline: data collection, training, and deployment. By continuously aligning the simulated world with the physical world, demonstrations can be collected in the real world with states extracted from the simulator. The simulator enables flexible state representations by rendering image inputs from any viewpoint or extracting low-level state information from objects embodied within the scene. During training, policies can be directly evaluated within the simulator in an offline and highly parallelizable manner. Finally, during deployment, policies are run within the simulator where the real robot directly tracks the simulated robot's joints, effectively decoupling policy execution from real hardware and mitigating traditional domain-transfer challenges. We validate real-is-sim on the PushT manipulation task, demonstrating strong correlation between success rates obtained in the simulator and real-world evaluations.

| **[Memorization in In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11546v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) with no additional training. However, the exact mechanism behind this performance improvement remains unclear. This study is the first to show how ICL surfaces memorized training data and to explore the correlation between this memorization and performance on downstream tasks across various ICL regimes: zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot. Our most notable findings include: (1) ICL significantly surfaces memorization compared to zero-shot learning in most cases; (2) demonstrations, without their labels, are the most effective element in surfacing memorization; (3) ICL improves performance when the surfaced memorization in few-shot regimes reaches a high level (about 40%); and (4) there is a very strong correlation between performance and memorization in ICL when it outperforms zero-shot learning. Overall, our study uncovers memorization as a new factor impacting ICL, raising an important question: to what extent do LLMs truly generalize from demonstrations in ICL, and how much of their success is due to memorization?</p></details> | v3 |
| **[WHERE and WHICH: Iterative Debate for Biomedical Synthetic Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23673v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) tasks, such as Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, and Text Classification, the scarcity of high-quality data remains a significant challenge. This limitation poisons large language models to correctly understand relationships between biological entities, such as molecules and diseases, or drug interactions, and further results in potential misinterpretation of biomedical documents. To address this issue, current approaches generally adopt the Synthetic Data Augmentation method which involves similarity computation followed by word replacement, but counterfactual data are usually generated. As a result, these methods disrupt meaningful word sets or produce sentences with meanings that deviate substantially from the original context, rendering them ineffective in improving model performance. To this end, this paper proposes a biomedical-dedicated rationale-based synthetic data augmentation method. Beyond the naive lexicon similarity, specific bio-relation similarity is measured to hold the augmented instance having a strong correlation with bio-relation instead of simply increasing the diversity of augmented data. Moreover, a multi-agents-involved reflection mechanism helps the model iteratively distinguish different usage of similar entities to escape falling into the mis-replace trap. We evaluate our method on the BLURB and BigBIO benchmark, which includes 9 common datasets spanning four major BioNLP tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges associated with data scarcity and enhancing the overall performance of biomedical NLP models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossWordBench: Evaluating the Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs and LVLMs with Controllable Puzzle Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00043v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reasoning evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) predominantly either assess text-based reasoning or vision-language understanding capabilities, with limited dynamic interplay between textual and visual constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles-a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in multiple formats (text and image) and offers different evaluation strategies ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs outperform non-reasoning models substantially by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings offer insights into the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion for Multi-Agent Trajectory Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18589v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory modeling has primarily focused on forecasting future states, often overlooking broader tasks like trajectory completion, which are crucial for real-world applications such as correcting tracking data. Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

| **[Unlocking Efficient Long-to-Short LLM Reasoning with Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20641v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition from System 1 to System 2 reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has marked significant advancements in handling complex tasks through deliberate, iterative thinking. However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality. Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency. While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models. Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity. Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

| **[Attribute-formed Class-specific Concept Space: Endowing Language Bottleneck Model with Better Interpretability and Scalability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20301v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Bottleneck Models (LBMs) are proposed to achieve interpretable image recognition by classifying images based on textual concept bottlenecks. However, current LBMs simply list all concepts together as the bottleneck layer, leading to the spurious cue inference problem and cannot generalized to unseen classes. To address these limitations, we propose the Attribute-formed Language Bottleneck Model (ALBM). ALBM organizes concepts in the attribute-formed class-specific space, where concepts are descriptions of specific attributes for specific classes. In this way, ALBM can avoid the spurious cue inference problem by classifying solely based on the essential concepts of each class. In addition, the cross-class unified attribute set also ensures that the concept spaces of different classes have strong correlations, as a result, the learned concept classifier can be easily generalized to unseen classes. Moreover, to further improve interpretability, we propose Visual Attribute Prompt Learning (VAPL) to extract visual features on fine-grained attributes. Furthermore, to avoid labor-intensive concept annotation, we propose the Description, Summary, and Supplement (DSS) strategy to automatically generate high-quality concept sets with a complete and precise attribute. Extensive experiments on 9 widely used few-shot benchmarks demonstrate the interpretability, transferability, and performance of our approach. The code and collected concept sets are available at https://github.com/tiggers23/ALBM.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Quantitative Assessment of Renal Chronicity Indices in Lupus Nephritis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21818v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Renal chronicity indices (CI) have been identified as strong predictors of long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis (LN) patients. However, assessment by pathologists is hindered by challenges such as substantial time requirements, high interobserver variation, and susceptibility to fatigue. This study aims to develop an effective deep learning (DL) pipeline that automates the assessment of CI and provides valuable prognostic insights from a disease-specific perspective. Methods: We curated a dataset comprising 282 slides obtained from 141 patients across two independent cohorts with a complete 10-years follow-up. Our DL pipeline was developed on 60 slides (22,410 patch images) from 30 patients in the training cohort and evaluated on both an internal testing set (148 slides, 77,605 patch images) and an external testing set (74 slides, 27,522 patch images). Results: The study included two cohorts with slight demographic differences, particularly in age and hemoglobin levels. The DL pipeline showed high segmentation performance across tissue compartments and histopathologic lesions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The DL pipeline also demonstrated a strong correlation with pathologists in assessing CI, significantly improving interobserver agreement. Additionally, the DL pipeline enhanced prognostic accuracy, particularly in outcome prediction, when combined with clinical parameters and pathologist-assessed CIs Conclusions: The DL pipeline demonstrated accuracy and efficiency in assessing CI in LN, showing promise in improving interobserver agreement among pathologists. It also exhibited significant value in prognostic analysis and enhancing outcome prediction in LN patients, offering a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Predictive Accuracy in Tennis: Integrating Fuzzy Logic and CV-GRNN for Dynamic Match Outcome and Player Momentum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21809v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The predictive analysis of match outcomes and player momentum in professional tennis has long been a subject of scholarly debate. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to game prediction by combining a multi-level fuzzy evaluation model with a CV-GRNN model. We first identify critical statistical indicators via Principal Component Analysis and then develop a two-tier fuzzy model based on the Wimbledon data. In addition, the results of Pearson Correlation Coefficient indicate that the momentum indicators, such as Player Win Streak and Score Difference, have a strong correlation among them, revealing insightful trends among players transitioning between losing and winning streaks. Subsequently, we refine the CV-GRNN model by incorporating 15 statistically significant indicators, resulting in an increase in accuracy to 86.64% and a decrease in MSE by 49.21%. This consequently strengthens the methodological framework for predicting tennis match outcomes, emphasizing its practical utility and potential for adaptation in various athletic contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages,10 figures,9 tables</p></details> |
| **[InPO: Inversion Preference Optimization with Reparametrized DDIM for Efficient Diffusion Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18454v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Without using explicit reward, direct preference optimization (DPO) employs paired human preference data to fine-tune generative models, a method that has garnered considerable attention in large language models (LLMs). However, exploration of aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences remains limited. In comparison to supervised fine-tuning, existing methods that align diffusion model suffer from low training efficiency and subpar generation quality due to the long Markov chain process and the intractability of the reverse process. To address these limitations, we introduce DDIM-InPO, an efficient method for direct preference alignment of diffusion models. Our approach conceptualizes diffusion model as a single-step generative model, allowing us to fine-tune the outputs of specific latent variables selectively. In order to accomplish this objective, we first assign implicit rewards to any latent variable directly via a reparameterization technique. Then we construct an Inversion technique to estimate appropriate latent variables for preference optimization. This modification process enables the diffusion model to only fine-tune the outputs of latent variables that have a strong correlation with the preference dataset. Experimental results indicate that our DDIM-InPO achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 400 steps of fine-tuning, surpassing all preference aligning baselines for T2I diffusion models in human preference evaluation tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[SPHINX-X: Scaling Data and Parameters for a Family of Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05935v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SPHINX-X, an extensive Multimodality Large Language Model (MLLM) series developed upon SPHINX. To improve the architecture and training efficiency, we modify the SPHINX framework by removing redundant visual encoders, bypassing fully-padded sub-images with skip tokens, and simplifying multi-stage training into a one-stage all-in-one paradigm. To fully unleash the potential of MLLMs, we assemble a comprehensive multi-domain and multimodal dataset covering publicly available resources in language, vision, and vision-language tasks. We further enrich this collection with our curated OCR intensive and Set-of-Mark datasets, extending the diversity and generality. By training over different base LLMs including TinyLlama1.1B, InternLM2-7B, LLaMA2-13B, and Mixtral8x7B, we obtain a spectrum of MLLMs that vary in parameter size and multilingual capabilities. Comprehensive benchmarking reveals a strong correlation between the multi-modal performance with the data and parameter scales.

| **[Digitally Prototype Your Eye Tracker: Simulating Hardware Performance using 3D Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16742v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye tracking (ET) is a key enabler for Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). Prototyping new ET hardware requires assessing the impact of hardware choices on eye tracking performance. This task is compounded by the high cost of obtaining data from sufficiently many variations of real hardware, especially for machine learning, which requires large training datasets. We propose a method for end-to-end evaluation of how hardware changes impact machine learning-based ET performance using only synthetic data. We utilize a dataset of real 3D eyes, reconstructed from light dome data using neural radiance fields (NeRF), to synthesize captured eyes from novel viewpoints and camera parameters. Using this framework, we demonstrate that we can predict the relative performance across various hardware configurations, accounting for variations in sensor noise, illumination brightness, and optical blur. We also compare our simulator with the publicly available eye tracking dataset from the Project Aria glasses, demonstrating a strong correlation with real-world performance. Finally, we present a first-of-its-kind analysis in which we vary ET camera positions, evaluating ET performance ranging from on-axis direct views of the eye to peripheral views on the frame. Such an analysis would have previously required manufacturing physical devices to capture evaluation data. In short, our method enables faster prototyping of ET hardware.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[High Temporal Consistency through Semantic Similarity Propagation in Semi-Supervised Video Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15676v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation from RGB cameras is essential to the perception of autonomous flying vehicles. The stability of predictions through the captured videos is paramount to their reliability and, by extension, to the trustworthiness of the agents. In this paper, we propose a lightweight video semantic segmentation approach-suited to onboard real-time inference-achieving high temporal consistency on aerial data through Semantic Similarity Propagation across frames. SSP temporally propagates the predictions of an efficient image segmentation model with global registration alignment to compensate for camera movements. It combines the current estimation and the prior prediction with linear interpolation using weights computed from the features similarities of the two frames. Because data availability is a challenge in this domain, we propose a consistency-aware Knowledge Distillation training procedure for sparsely labeled datasets with few annotations. Using a large image segmentation model as a teacher to train the efficient SSP, we leverage the strong correlations between labeled and unlabeled frames in the same training videos to obtain high-quality supervision on all frames. KD-SSP obtains a significant temporal consistency increase over the base image segmentation model of 12.5% and 6.7% TC on UAVid and RuralScapes respectively, with higher accuracy and comparable inference speed. On these aerial datasets, KD-SSP provides a superior segmentation quality and inference speed trade-off than other video methods proposed for general applications and shows considerably higher consistency. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TestGenEval: A Real World Unit Test Generation and Test Completion Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00752v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation models can help improve many common software tasks ranging from code completion to defect prediction. Most of the existing benchmarks for code generation LLMs focus on code authoring or code completion. Surprisingly, there has been far less effort dedicated to benchmarking software testing, despite the strong correlation between well-tested software and effective bug detection. To address this gap, we create and release TestGenEval, a large-scale benchmark to measure test generation performance. Based on SWEBench, TestGenEval comprises 68,647 tests from 1,210 code and test file pairs across 11 well-maintained Python repositories. It covers initial tests authoring, test suite completion, and code coverage improvements. Test authoring simulates the process of a developer writing a test suite from scratch, while test completion mimics the scenario where a developer aims to improve the coverage of an existing test suite. We evaluate several popular models, with sizes ranging from 7B to 405B parameters. Our detailed analysis highlights TestGenEval's contribution to a comprehensive evaluation of test generation performance. In particular, models struggle to generate high-coverage test suites, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving an average coverage of only 35.2%. This is primarily due to models struggling to reason about execution, and their frequent assertion errors when addressing complex code paths.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19108v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

| **[Arab Spring's Impact on Science through the Lens of Scholarly Attention, Funding, and Migration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13238v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Arab Spring is a major socio-political movement that reshaped democratic aspirations in the Middle East and North Africa, attracting global attention through news, social media, and academic discourse. However, its consequences on the academic landscape in the region are still unclear. Here, we conduct the first study of scholarly attention toward 10 target countries affected by the Arab Spring by analyzing more than 25 million articles published from 2002 to 2019. We find that changes in scholarly attention were unevenly distributed among target countries, with Egypt attracting the most attention. We reveal strong correlations between increases in scholarly attention given by source countries and increases in funding for research about the target countries as well as increased immigration of scholars from the affected region to them. Notably, our analysis reveals Saudi Arabia's positioning as a key player, among Western nations, that shapes research in the region.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose as a Modality: A Psychology-Inspired Network for Personality Recognition with a New Multimodal Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12912v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, predicting Big Five personality traits from multimodal data has received significant attention in artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing computational models often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. Psychological research has shown a strong correlation between pose and personality traits, yet previous research has largely ignored pose data in computational models. To address this gap, we develop a novel multimodal dataset that incorporates full-body pose data. The dataset includes video recordings of 287 participants completing a virtual interview with 36 questions, along with self-reported Big Five personality scores as labels. To effectively utilize this multimodal data, we introduce the Psychology-Inspired Network (PINet), which consists of three key modules: Multimodal Feature Awareness (MFA), Multimodal Feature Interaction (MFI), and Psychology-Informed Modality Correlation Loss (PIMC Loss). The MFA module leverages the Vision Mamba Block to capture comprehensive visual features related to personality, while the MFI module efficiently fuses the multimodal features. The PIMC Loss, grounded in psychological theory, guides the model to emphasize different modalities for different personality dimensions. Experimental results show that the PINet outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline models. Furthermore, the three modules of PINet contribute almost equally to the model's overall performance. Incorporating pose data significantly enhances the model's performance, with the pose modality ranking mid-level in importance among the five modalities. These findings address the existing gap in personality-related datasets that lack full-body pose data and provide a new approach for improving the accuracy of personality prediction models, highlighting the importance of integrating psychological insights into AI frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, AAAI 2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[Fragile Mastery: Are Domain-Specific Trade-Offs Undermining On-Device Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22698v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of on-device language models (ODLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is a multi-dimensional problem that strikes a fine balance between computational effectiveness, memory, power usage, and linguistic capacity across heterogeneous tasks. This holistic study conducts a thorough investigation of the trade-offs between domain-specific optimization and cross-domain robustness, culminating in the proposal of the Generalized Edge Model (GEM), a new architecture that aims to balance specialization and generalization in a harmonious manner. With a rigorous experimental approach testing 47 well-chosen benchmarks in eight domains--healthcare, law, finance, STEM, commonsense, conversational AI, multilingual, and domain-adaptive tasks--we show that conventional optimization techniques decrease target task perplexity by 18-25% but result in a precipitous decline in general-task performance with F1 scores decreasing by 12-29%, as reported by Liu et al. GEM employs a Sparse Cross-Attention Router (SCAR) to dynamically allocate computation to a variable number of computing resources with a cross-domain F1 accuracy of 0.89 on less than 100ms latency across Raspberry Pi 4, Pixel 6, iPhone 13, and bespoke custom neural processing units (NPUs). Compared to GPT-4 Lite, GEM enhances the general-task level by 7% with respect and parity in domain-specific performance. We propose three new measurement tools--Domain Specialization Index (DSI), Generalization Gap (GG), and Cross-Domain Transfer Ratio (CDTR)--which show strong correlation between model compression intensity and brittleness.</p></details> | 14 Pages, 5 figures |

However, the high inference costs associated with these models have not received adequate attention, particularly when compared to the focus on training costs in existing research. In response to this gap, our study conducts a comprehensive benchmarking of LLM inference energy across a wide range of NLP tasks, where we analyze the impact of different models, tasks, prompts, and system-related factors on inference energy. Specifically, our experiments reveal several interesting insights, including strong correlation of inference energy with output token length and response time. Also, we find that quantization and optimal batch sizes, along with targeted prompt phrases, can significantly reduce energy usage. This study is the first to thoroughly benchmark LLM inference across such a diverse range of aspects, providing insights and offering several recommendations for improving energy efficiency in model deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NAACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Recent evidence indicates a strong correlation between the sharpness of a minimum and its generalization error, leading to increased interest in optimization methods that explicitly seek flatter minima for improved generalization. Despite its contemporary relevance to overparameterization, however, this sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) strategy has not been studied much yet as to exactly how it is affected by overparameterization. In this work, we analyze SAM under varying degrees of overparameterization, presenting both empirical and theoretical findings that reveal its critical influence on SAM's effectiveness. First, we conduct extensive numerical experiments across diverse domains, demonstrating that SAM consistently benefits from overparameterization. Next, we attribute this phenomenon to the interplay between the enlarged solution space and increased implicit bias resulting from overparameterization. Furthermore, we show that this effect is particularly pronounced in practical settings involving label noise and sparsity, and yet, sufficient regularization is necessary. Last but not least, we provide other theoretical insights into how overparameterization helps SAM achieve minima with more uniform Hessian moments compared to SGD, and much faster convergence at a linear rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiasConnect: Investigating Bias Interactions in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09763v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The biases exhibited by Text-to-Image (TTI) models are often treated as if they are independent, but in reality, they may be deeply interrelated. Addressing bias along one dimension, such as ethnicity or age, can inadvertently influence another dimension, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities. Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a challenge. In this paper, we aim to address these questions by introducing BiasConnect, a novel tool designed to analyze and quantify bias interactions in TTI models. Our approach leverages a counterfactual-based framework to generate pairwise causal graphs that reveals the underlying structure of bias interactions for the given text prompt. Additionally, our method provides empirical estimates that indicate how other bias dimensions shift toward or away from an ideal distribution when a given bias is modified. Our estimates have a strong correlation (+0.69) with the interdependency observations post bias mitigation. We demonstrate the utility of BiasConnect for selecting optimal bias mitigation axes, comparing different TTI models on the dependencies they learn, and understanding the amplification of intersectional societal biases in TTI models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{COVER} (\textbf{\underline{CO}}unterfactual \textbf{\underline{V}}id\textbf{\underline{E}}o \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding.

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

Numerous studies emphasize the significance of the quality of instruction tuning (IT) data, revealing a strong correlation between IT data quality and the alignment performance of LLMs. In these studies, the quality of IT data is typically assessed by evaluating the performance of LLMs trained with that data. However, we identified a prevalent issue in such practice: hyperparameters for training models are often selected arbitrarily without adequate justification. We observed significant variations in hyperparameters applied across different studies, even when training the same model with the same data. In this study, we demonstrate the potential problems arising from this practice and emphasize the need for careful consideration in verifying data quality. Through our experiments on the quality of LIMA data and a selected set of 1,000 Alpaca data points, we demonstrate that arbitrary hyperparameter decisions can make any arbitrary conclusion.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Research shows a strong correlation between abdominal muscle and fat tissue composition and patient outcomes. However, existing manual methods for analyzing abdominal tissue composition are time-consuming and costly, limiting clinical research scalability. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-driven tool for automated analysis of abdominal CT scans to effectively identify and segment muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat. Our tool integrates a multi-view localization model and a high-precision 2D nnUNet-based segmentation model, demonstrating a localization accuracy of 90% and a Dice Score Coefficient of 0.967 for segmentation. Furthermore, it features an interactive interface that allows clinicians to refine the segmentation results, ensuring high-quality outcomes effectively. Our tool offers a standardized method for effectively extracting critical abdominal tissues, potentially enhancing the management and treatment for gastrointestinal cancers.

| **[Taking Notes Brings Focus? Towards Multi-Turn Multimodal Dialogue Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07002v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), built on large-scale pre-trained vision towers and language models, have shown great capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, most existing MLLMs are trained on single-turn vision question-answering tasks, which do not accurately reflect real-world human conversations. In this paper, we introduce MMDiag, a multi-turn multimodal dialogue dataset. This dataset is collaboratively generated through deliberately designed rules and GPT assistance, featuring strong correlations between questions, between questions and images, and among different image regions; thus aligning more closely with real-world scenarios. MMDiag serves as a strong benchmark for multi-turn multimodal dialogue learning and brings more challenges to the grounding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Further, inspired by human vision processing, we present DiagNote, an MLLM equipped with multimodal grounding and reasoning capabilities. DiagNote consists of two modules (Deliberate and Gaze) interacting with each other to perform Chain-of-Thought and annotations respectively, throughout multi-turn dialogues. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of DiagNote in both grounding and jointly processing and reasoning with vision and language information over existing MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, its comparability to traditional computerized methods remains unclear. This study investigates the convergent validity, user experience, and usability of VR-based versus PC-based assessments of short-term and working memory, and psychomotor skills, while also examining how demographic and IT-related skills influence performance in both modalities. Methods: Sixty-six participants performed the Digit Span Task (DST), Corsi Block Task (CBT), and Deary-Liewald Reaction Time Task (DLRTT) in both VR- and PC-based formats. Participants' experience in using computers and smartphones, and playing videogames, was considered. User experience and system usability of the formats were also evaluated. Results: While performance on DST was similar across modalities, PC assessments enabled better performance on CBT and faster reaction times in DLRTT. Moderate-to-strong correlations between VR and PC versions supported convergent validity. Regression analyses revealed that performance on PC versions was influenced by age, computing, and gaming experience, whereas performance on VR versions was largely independent of these factors, except for gaming experience predicting performance on CBT backward recall. Moreover, VR assessments received higher ratings for user experience and usability than PC-based assessments. Conclusion: Immersive VR assessments provide an engaging alternative to traditional computerized methods, with minimal reliance on prior IT experience and demographic factors. This resilience to individual differences suggests that VR may offer a more equitable and accessible platform for cognitive assessment. Future research should explore the long-term reliability of VR-based assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables, submitted to Journal of International Neuropsychological Society</p></details> |

We introduce a benchmark to evaluate whether video-large language models (Video-LLMs) can naturally process continuous first-person visual observations like humans, enabling recall, perception, reasoning, and navigation. We have manually control drones to collect 3D embodied motion video data from real-world cities and simulated environments, resulting in 1.5k video clips. Then we design a pipeline to generate 5.2k multiple-choice questions. Evaluations of 17 widely-used Video-LLMs reveal current limitations in urban embodied cognition. Correlation analysis provides insight into the relationships between different tasks, showing that causal reasoning has a strong correlation with recall, perception, and navigation, while the abilities for counterfactual and associative reasoning exhibit lower correlation with other tasks. We also validate the potential for Sim-to-Real transfer in urban embodiment through fine-tuning.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[No Free Labels: Limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge Without Human Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05061v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-as-a-Judge is a framework that uses an LLM (large language model) to evaluate the quality of natural language text - typically text that is also generated by an LLM. This framework holds great promise due to its relative low-cost, ease of use, and strong correlations with human stylistic preferences. However, LLM Judges have been shown to exhibit biases that can distort their judgments. We evaluate how well LLM Judges can grade whether a given response to a conversational question is correct, an ability crucial to soundly estimating the overall response quality. To do so, we create and publicly release a human-annotated dataset with labels of correctness for 1,200 LLM responses. We source questions from a combination of existing datasets and a novel, challenging benchmark (BFF-Bench) created for this analysis. We demonstrate a strong connection between an LLM's ability to correctly answer a question and grade responses to that question. Although aggregate level statistics might imply a judge has high agreement with human annotators, it will struggle on the subset of questions it could not answer. To address this issue, we recommend a simple solution: provide the judge with a correct, human-written reference answer. We perform an in-depth analysis on how reference quality can affect the performance of an LLM Judge. We show that providing a weaker judge (e.g. Qwen 2.5 7B) with higher quality references reaches better agreement with human annotators than a stronger judge (e.g. GPT-4o) with synthetic references.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenCeption: Evaluate Vision LLMs with Unlabeled Unimodal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14973v4)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically assessed using expensive annotated multimodal benchmarks, which often lag behind the rapidly evolving demands of MLLM evaluation. This paper outlines and validates GenCeption, a novel, annotation-free evaluation method that requires only unimodal data to measure inter-modality semantic coherence and inversely assesses MLLMs' tendency to hallucinate. This approach eliminates the need for costly data annotation, minimizes the risk of training data contamination, is expected to result in slower benchmark saturation, and avoids the illusion of emerging abilities. Inspired by the DrawCeption game, GenCeption begins with a non-textual sample and proceeds through iterative description and generation steps. The semantic drift across iterations is quantified using the GC@T metric. While GenCeption is principally applicable to MLLMs across various modalities, this paper focuses on its implementation and validation for Vision LLMs (VLLMs). Based on the GenCeption method, we establish the MMECeption benchmark for evaluating VLLMs, and compare the performance of several popular VLLMs and human annotators. Our empirical results validate GenCeption's effectiveness, demonstrating strong correlations with established VLLM benchmarks. VLLMs still significantly lag behind human performance and struggle especially with text-intensive tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Computer Speech & Language (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csl.2025.101785).

To this end, we adapt two state-of-the-art techniques from natural language generation -- one based on entropy and another on mutual information -- to the domain of code generation. Given the distinct semantic properties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic equivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and correctness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality assessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based method that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses, demonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an abstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when uncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero. Our evaluation on the LiveCodeBench shows that our approach significantly outperforms a baseline relying solely on LLM-reported log-probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 3 References Pages</p></details> |

The proposed method relies upon a reformulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which allows for an exact quadratic formulation of the dynamics of perturbations about a steady base flow. To facilitate the structured input-output analysis, a pseudo-linear model for the quadratic nonlinearity is proposed and the structural information of the nonlinearity is embedded into a structured uncertainty comprising unknown `perturbations'. The structured singular value framework is employed to compute the input-output gain, which provides an estimate of the robust stability margin of the flow perturbations, as well as the forcing and response modes that are consistent with the nonlinearity structure. The analysis is then carried out on a plane, laminar compressible Couette flow over a range of Mach numbers. The structured input-output gains identify an instability mechanism, characterized by a spanwise elongated structure in the streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space at a subsonic Mach number, that takes the form of an oblique structure at sonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In addition, the structured input-output forcing and response modes provide insight into the thermodynamic and momentum characteristics associated with a source of instability. Comparisons with a resolvent/unstructured analysis reveal discrepancies in the distribution of input-output gains over the wavenumber space as well as in the modal behavior of an instability, thus highlighting the strong correlation between the structural information of the nonlinearity and the underlying flow physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review in Journal of Fluid Mechanics</p></details> |

Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

In this regard, Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach in computational chemistry and materials science, combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods with computational efficiency orders of magnitude superior to ab-initio methods. This chapter provides an introduction of the fundamentals of learning and how it is applied to construct MLFFs, detailing key methodologies such as neural network potentials and kernel-based models. Emphasis is placed on the construction of SchNet model, as one of the most elemental neural network-based force fields that are nowadays the basis of modern architectures. Additionally, the GDML framework is described in detail as an example of how the elegant formulation of kernel methods can be used to construct mathematically robust and physics-inspired MLFFs. The ongoing advancements in MLFF development continue to expand their applicability, enabling precise simulations of large and complex systems that were previously beyond reach. This chapter concludes by highlighting the transformative impact of MLFFs on scientific research, underscoring their role in driving future discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics, and materials science.</p></details> | 9 figures |

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Auto-ADMET: An Effective and Interpretable AutoML Method for Chemical ADMET Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16378v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has been playing important roles in drug discovery in the past years by providing (pre-)screening tools for prioritising chemical compounds to pass through wet lab experiments. One of the main ML tasks in drug discovery is to build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an activity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound behaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods exist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's personalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since the chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact leads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by the model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to solve this issue, outputting tailored ML algorithms to the data at hand. Although an important task, AutoML has not been practically used to assist cheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few works related to the field. To address these challenges, this work introduces Auto-ADMET, an interpretable evolutionary-based AutoML method for chemical ADMET property prediction. Auto-ADMET employs a Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) method with a Bayesian Network Model to achieve comparable or better predictive performance against three alternative methods -- standard GGP method, pkCSM and XGBOOST model -- on 12 benchmark chemical ADMET property prediction datasets. The use of a Bayesian Network model on Auto-ADMET's evolutionary process assisted in both shaping the search procedure and interpreting the causes of its AutoML performance.</p></details> |  |

However, full KRR solvers are challenging to scale to large datasets: both direct (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (i.e., PCG) incur prohibitive computational and storage costs. The standard approach to scale KRR to large datasets chooses a set of inducing points and solves an approximate version of the problem, inducing points KRR. However, the resulting solution tends to have worse predictive performance than the full KRR solution. In this work, we introduce a new solver, ASkotch, for full KRR that provides better solutions faster than state-of-the-art solvers for full and inducing points KRR. ASkotch is a scalable, accelerated, iterative method for full KRR that provably obtains linear convergence. Under appropriate conditions, we show that ASkotch obtains condition-number-free linear convergence. This convergence analysis rests on the theory of ridge leverage scores and determinantal point processes. ASkotch outperforms state-of-the-art KRR solvers on a testbed of 23 large-scale KRR regression and classification tasks derived from a wide range of application domains, demonstrating the superiority of full KRR over inducing points KRR. Our work opens up the possibility of as-yet-unimagined applications of full KRR across a number of disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages (including appendices), 16 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically-constrained approach, suggesting that using the forces as explicit learning targets yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency - and that energy conservation can be learned during training. The present work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Contrary to the case of rotational symmetry, lack of energy conservation is hard to learn, control, and correct. The best approach to exploit the acceleration afforded by direct force evaluation might be to use it in tandem with a conservative model, reducing - rather than eliminating - the additional cost of backpropagation, but avoiding most of the pathological behavior associated with non-conservative forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (including references) + appendix Conference format</p></details> |

Catalyst discovery is fundamental yet challenging in computational chemistry and has garnered significant attention due to the promising performance of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) notably accelerates progress in the discovery of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, where their chemical reactions differ significantly in material phases, temperature, dynamics, etc. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that discusses the progress and latest developments in both areas, particularly with the application of LLM techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a thorough and systematic survey of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, employing a unified and general categorization for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. We examine the progress of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, highlighting their individual advantages and disadvantages, and discuss the challenges faced in this field. Furthermore, we suggest potential directions for future research from the perspective of computer science. Our goal is to assist researchers in computational chemistry, computer science, and related fields in easily tracking the latest advancements, providing a clear overview and roadmap of this area. We also organize and make accessible relevant resources, including article lists and datasets, in an open repository at https://github.com/LuckyGirl-XU/Awesome-Artificial-Intelligence-Empowered-Catalyst-Discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Scalable Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction through Adaptive Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01171v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian matrix prediction is pivotal in computational chemistry, serving as the foundation for determining a wide range of molecular properties. While SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their substantial computational cost-driven by high-order tensor product (TP) operations-restricts their scalability to large molecular systems with extensive basis sets. To address this challenge, we introduce SPHNet, an efficient and scalable equivariant network that incorporates adaptive sparsity into Hamiltonian prediction. SPHNet employs two innovative sparse gates to selectively constrain non-critical interaction combinations, significantly reducing tensor product computations while maintaining accuracy. To optimize the sparse representation, we develop a Three-phase Sparsity Scheduler, ensuring stable convergence and achieving high performance at sparsity rates of up to 70 percent. Extensive evaluations on QH9 and PubchemQH datasets demonstrate that SPHNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing up to a 7x speedup over existing models. Beyond Hamiltonian prediction, the proposed sparsification techniques also hold significant potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of other SE(3) equivariant networks, further broadening their applicability and impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |

Self-attention offers a compelling mechanism for capturing these global effects, but its quadratic complexity presents a significant practical limitation. This problem is particularly pronounced in computational chemistry, where the stringent efficiency requirements of machine learning force fields (MLFFs) often preclude accurately modeling long-range interactions. To address this, we introduce Euclidean fast attention (EFA), a linear-scaling attention-like mechanism designed for Euclidean data, which can be easily incorporated into existing model architectures. A core component of EFA are novel Euclidean rotary positional encodings (ERoPE), which enable efficient encoding of spatial information while respecting essential physical symmetries. We empirically demonstrate that EFA effectively captures diverse long-range effects, enabling EFA-equipped MLFFs to describe challenging chemical interactions for which conventional MLFFs yield incorrect results.</p></details> |  |

We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations.

| **[A large language model-type architecture for high-dimensional molecular potential energy surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03831v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing high dimensional potential surfaces for molecular and materials systems is considered to be a great challenge in computational chemistry with potential impact in a range of areas including fundamental prediction of reaction rates. In this paper we design and discuss an algorithm that has similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which contains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets, which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51 dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to the graph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system. We then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional neural networks can be transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186 dimensional potential surface. We find that our algorithm does provide reasonably accurate results for this larger dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher dimensional potential surface problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Riemannian Denoising Score Matching for Molecular Structure Optimization with Accurate Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19769v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a modified score matching method aimed at generating molecular structures with high energy accuracy. The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p></details> |  |

The recent GNoME protocol identifies over 380,000 novel stable crystals. From this, we identify over 33,000 materials with potential as energy materials forming the Energy-GNoME database. Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tools, our protocol mitigates cross-domain data bias using feature spaces to identify potential candidates for thermoelectric materials, novel battery cathodes, and novel perovskites. Classifiers with both structural and compositional features identify domains of applicability, where we expect enhanced accuracy of the regressors. Such regressors are trained to predict key materials properties like, thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), band gap (Eg), and cathode voltage ($\Delta V_c$).

| **[Pre-trained Molecular Language Models with Random Functional Group Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01401v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in computational chemistry have leveraged the power of trans-former-based language models, such as MoLFormer, pre-trained using a vast amount of simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) sequences, to understand and predict molecular properties and activities, a critical step in fields like drug discovery and materials science. To further improve performance, researchers have introduced graph neural networks with graph-based molecular representations, such as GEM, incorporating the topology, geometry, 2D or even 3D structures of molecules into pre-training. While most of molecular graphs in existing studies were automatically converted from SMILES sequences, it is to assume that transformer-based language models might be able to implicitly learn structure-aware representations from SMILES sequences. In this paper, we propose \ours{} -- a SMILES-based \underline{\em M}olecular \underline{\em L}anguage \underline{\em M}odel, which randomly masking SMILES subsequences corresponding to specific molecular \underline{\em F}unctional \underline{\em G}roups to incorporate structure information of atoms during the pre-training phase. This technique aims to compel the model to better infer molecular structures and properties, thus enhancing its predictive capabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations across 11 benchmark classification and regression tasks in the chemical domain demonstrate the robustness and superiority of \ours{}. Our findings reveal that \ours{} outperforms existing pre-training models, either based on SMILES or graphs, in 9 out of the 11 downstream tasks, ranking as a close second in the remaining ones.</p></details> | Under review |

Some alternatives based on (piecewise deterministic) kinetic velocity jumpprocesses have gained interest over the last decade. One interest of the latter is the possibility to split forces(at the continuous-time level), reducing the numerical cost for sampling the trajectory. Motivated by this, anumerical scheme based on hybrid dynamics combining velocity jumps and Langevin diffusion, numericallymore efficient than their classical Langevin counterparts, has been introduced for computational chemistry in [42]. The present work is devoted to the numerical analysis of this scheme. Our main results are, first, theexponential ergodicity of the continuous-time velocity jump Langevin process, second, a Talay-Tubaro expan-sion of the invariant measure of the numerical scheme, showing in particular that the scheme is of weak order2 in the step-size and, third, a bound on the quadratic risk of the corresponding practical MCMC estimator(possibly with Richardson extrapolation). With respect to previous works on the Langevin diffusion, newdifficulties arise from the jump operator, which is non-local.</p></details> |  |
| **[REBIND: Enhancing ground-state molecular conformation via force-based graph rewiring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14696v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the ground-state 3D molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs is critical in computational chemistry due to its profound impact on molecular properties. Deep learning (DL) approaches have recently emerged as promising alternatives to computationally-heavy classical methods such as density functional theory (DFT). However, we discover that existing DL methods inadequately model inter-atomic forces, particularly for non-bonded atomic pairs, due to their naive usage of bonds and pairwise distances. Consequently, significant prediction errors occur for atoms with low degree (i.e., low coordination numbers) whose conformations are primarily influenced by non-bonded interactions. To address this, we propose REBIND, a novel framework that rewires molecular graphs by adding edges based on the Lennard-Jones potential to capture non-bonded interactions for low-degree atoms. Experimental results demonstrate that REBIND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various molecular sizes, achieving up to a 20\% reduction in prediction error.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[How Do Large Language Models Understand Graph Patterns? A Benchmark for Graph Pattern Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05298v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in graph-related tasks is becoming an increasingly popular and crucial area of research. Recent studies have shown that LLMs exhibit a preliminary ability to understand graph structures and node features. However, the potential of LLMs in graph pattern mining remains largely unexplored. This is a key component in fields such as computational chemistry, biology, and social network analysis. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs' capabilities in graph pattern tasks. We have developed a benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can understand graph patterns based on either terminological or topological descriptions. Additionally, our benchmark tests the LLMs' capacity to autonomously discover graph patterns from data. The benchmark encompasses both synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of models, with a total of 11 tasks and 7 models. Our experimental framework is designed for easy expansion to accommodate new models and datasets. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs have preliminary abilities to understand graph patterns, with O1-mini outperforming in the majority of tasks; (2) Formatting input data to align with the knowledge acquired during pretraining can enhance performance; (3) The strategies employed by LLMs may differ from those used in conventional algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Exposure Bias in Score-Based Generation of Molecular Conformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14014v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular conformation generation poses a significant challenge in the field of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9. We provide the code publicly at https://github.com/jia-975/torsionalDiff-ip.</p></details> | SMC 2024 |

Generative AI methods have made significant progress in sampling molecular structures across chemical species, developing force fields, and speeding up simulations. This Perspective offers a structured overview, beginning with the fundamental theoretical concepts in both Generative AI and computational chemistry. It then covers widely used Generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before, and that Generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry. We suggest that to overcome these challenges, future AI models need to integrate core chemical principles, especially from statistical mechanics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Maize: Cyclic and conditional computational graphs for molecular simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10064v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many computational chemistry and molecular simulation workflows can be expressed as graphs. This abstraction is useful to modularize and potentially reuse existing components, as well as provide parallelization and ease reproducibility. Existing tools represent the computation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), thus allowing efficient execution by parallelization of concurrent branches. These systems can, however, generally not express cyclic and conditional workflows. We therefore developed Maize, a workflow manager for cyclic and conditional graphs based on the principles of flow-based programming. By running each node of the graph concurrently in separate processes and allowing communication at any time through dedicated inter-node channels, arbitrary graph structures can be executed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool on a dynamic active learning task in computational drug design, involving the use of a small molecule generative model and an associated scoring system, and on a reactivity prediction pipeline using quantum-chemistry and semiempirical approaches.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s Walter Fontana and Leo Buss proposed a novel modeling approach to this question, based on a formal model of computation known as $\lambda$ calculus. The model demonstrated how simple rules, embedded in a combinatorially large space of possibilities, could yield complex, dynamically stable organizations, reminiscent of biochemical reaction networks. Here, we revisit this classic model, called AlChemy, which has been understudied over the past thirty years. We reproduce the original results and study the robustness of those results using the greater computing resources available today. Our analysis reveals several unanticipated features of the system, demonstrating a surprising mix of dynamical robustness and fragility. Specifically, we find that complex, stable organizations emerge more frequently than previously expected, that these organizations are robust against collapse into trivial fixed-points, but that these stable organizations cannot be easily combined into higher order entities. We also study the role played by the random generators used in the model, characterizing the initial distribution of objects produced by two random expression generators, and their consequences on the results. Finally, we provide a constructive proof that shows how an extension of the model, based on typed $\lambda$ calculus, could simulate transitions between arbitrary states in any possible chemical reaction network, thus indicating a concrete connection between AlChemy and chemical reaction networks. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of AlChemy to self-organization in modern programming languages and quantitative approaches to the origin of life.</p></details> |  |

General sparse tensor algebra compilers are not always versatile enough to generate asymptotically optimal code for sparse tensor contractions. This paper shows how to generate asymptotically better schedules for complex sparse tensor expressions using kernel fission and fusion. We present generalized loop restructuring transformations to reduce asymptotic time complexity and memory footprint. Furthermore, we present an auto-scheduler that uses a partially ordered set (poset)-based cost model that uses both time and auxiliary memory complexities to prune the search space of schedules. In addition, we highlight the use of Satisfiability Module Theory (SMT) solvers in sparse auto-schedulers to approximate the Pareto frontier of better schedules to the smallest number of possible schedules, with user-defined constraints available at compile-time. Finally, we show that our auto-scheduler can select better-performing schedules and generate code for them. Our results show that the auto-scheduler provided schedules achieve orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to the code generated by the Tensor Algebra Compiler (TACO) for several computations on different real-world tensors.</p></details> |  |

Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a promising solution for constructing atomistic potentials that can be transferred across different molecular and crystalline systems. Most MLIPs are trained only on energies and forces in vacuum, while an improved description of the potential energy surface could be achieved by including the curvature of the potential energy surface. We present Hessian QM9, the first database of equilibrium configurations and numerical Hessian matrices, consisting of 41,645 molecules from the QM9 dataset at the $\omega$B97x/6-31G* level. Molecular Hessians were calculated in vacuum, as well as water, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene using an implicit solvation model. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we show that incorporating second derivatives of the potential energy surface into the loss function of a MLIP significantly improves the prediction of vibrational frequencies in all solvent environments, thus making this dataset extremely useful for studying organic molecules in realistic solvent environments for experimental characterization.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figues |
| **[StringNET: Neural Network based Variational Method for Transition Pathways](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12621v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare transition events in meta-stable systems under noisy fluctuations are crucial for many non-equilibrium physical and chemical processes. In these processes, the primary contributions to reactive flux are predominantly near the transition pathways that connect two meta-stable states. Efficient computation of these paths is essential in computational chemistry. In this work, we examine the temperature-dependent maximum flux path, the minimum energy path, and the minimum action path at zero temperature. We propose the StringNET method for training these paths using variational formulations and deep learning techniques. Unlike traditional chain-of-state methods, StringNET directly parametrizes the paths through neural network functions, utilizing the arc-length parameter as the main input. The tasks of gradient descent and re-parametrization in the string method are unified into a single framework using loss functions to train deep neural networks. More importantly, the loss function for the maximum flux path is interpreted as a softmax approximation to the numerically challenging minimax problem of the minimum energy path. To compute the minimum energy path efficiently and robustly, we developed a pre-training strategy that includes the maximum flux path loss in the early training stage, significantly accelerating the computation of minimum energy and action paths. We demonstrate the superior performance of this method through various analytical and chemical examples, as well as the two- and four-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau functional energy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion with time step prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10935v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field (FF) methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network FF models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface (PES) instead of the complex physical PES. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical FFs, equivariant neural network FFs trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their energies.</p></details> |  |

The method has been shown to reduce the cost of generating training data for high-accuracy low-cost ML models. In such a set-up, the ML models are trained on molecular geometries and some property of interest computed at various computational chemistry accuracies, or fidelities. These are then combined in training the MFML models. In some multifidelity models, the training data is required to be nested, that is the same molecular geometries are included to calculate the property across all the fidelities. In these multifidelity models, the requirement of a nested configuration restricts the kind of sampling that can be performed while selection training samples at different fidelities. This work assesses the use of non-nested training data for two of these multifidelity methods, namely MFML and optimized MFML (o-MFML). The assessment is carried out for the prediction of ground state energies and first vertical excitation energies of a diverse collection of molecules of the CheMFi dataset. Results indicate that the MFML method still requires a nested structure of training data across the fidelities. However, the o-MFML method shows promising results for non-nested multifidelity training data with model errors comparable to the nested configurations.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Finally, we show that our approach facilitates MLIPs' training in a setting where the computation of forces is infeasible at the reference level, such as those employing complete-basis-set extrapolation.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 2 figures, 18 Tables</p></details> |

Hypergraphs are not merely an extension of traditional graphs; they are pivotal for modeling high-order relationships, a capability that conventional equivariant graph-based methods lack due to their inherent limitations in representing intricate many-body interactions. To achieve this, we first construct hypergraphs via proposing a new fragmentation method that considers both chemical and three-dimensional spatial information of molecular system. We then design SE3Set, which incorporates equivariance into the hypergragh neural network. This ensures that the learned molecular representations are invariant to spatial transformations, thereby providing robustness essential for accurate prediction of molecular properties. SE3Set has shown performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for small molecule datasets like QM9 and MD17. It excels on the MD22 dataset, achieving a notable improvement of approximately 20% in accuracy across all molecules, which highlights the prevalence of complex many-body interactions in larger molecules. This exceptional performance of SE3Set across diverse molecular structures underscores its transformative potential in computational chemistry, offering a route to more accurate and physically nuanced modeling.</p></details> |  |

Even on exascale supercomputers, however, runtimes are excessive for systems and timescales of scientific interest. Here, we demonstrate strong scaling of MD simulations on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine. By dedicating a processor core for each simulated atom, we demonstrate a 179-fold improvement in timesteps per second versus the Frontier GPU-based Exascale platform, along with a large improvement in timesteps per unit energy. Reducing every year of runtime to two days unlocks currently inaccessible timescales of slow microstructure transformation processes that are critical for understanding material behavior and function. Our dataflow algorithm runs Embedded Atom Method (EAM) simulations at rates over 270,000 timesteps per second for problems with up to 800k atoms. This demonstrated performance is unprecedented for general-purpose processing cores.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Domain Decomposition Method for Poisson--Boltzmann Equations based on Solvent Excluded Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06862v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a domain decomposition method for the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation based on a solvent-excluded surface widely used in computational chemistry. The model relies on a nonlinear equation defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a space-dependent dielectric permittivity and an ion-exclusion function that accounts for steric effects. Potential theory arguments transform the nonlinear equation into two coupled equations defined in a bounded domain. Then, the Schwarz decomposition method is used to formulate local problems by decomposing the cavity into overlapping balls and only solving a set of coupled sub-equations in each ball. The main novelty of the proposed method is the introduction of a hybrid linear-nonlinear solver used to solve the equation. A series of numerical experiments are presented to test the method and show the importance of the nonlinear model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond MD17: the reactive xxMD dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11155v3)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System specific neural force fields (NFFs) have gained popularity in computational chemistry. One of the most popular datasets as a bencharmk to develop NFFs models is the MD17 dataset and its subsequent extension. These datasets comprise geometries from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy surface, sampled from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical reactions involve significant molecular geometrical deformations, for example, bond breaking. Therefore, MD17 is inadequate to represent a chemical reaction. To address this limitation in MD17, we introduce a new dataset, called Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics (xxMD) dataset. The xxMD dataset involves geometries sampled from direct non-adiabatic dynamics, and the energies are computed at both multireference wavefunction theory and density functional theory. We show that the xxMD dataset involves diverse geometries which represent chemical reactions. Assessment of NFF models on xxMD dataset reveals significantly higher predictive errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This work underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF model with extrapolation capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, many figures.

| **[HOSCF: Efficient decoupling algorithms for finding the best rank-one approximation of higher-order tensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01778v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Best rank-one approximation is one of the most fundamental tasks in tensor computation. In order to fully exploit modern multi-core parallel computers, it is necessary to develop decoupling algorithms for computing the best rank-one approximation of higher-order tensors at large scales. In this paper, we first build a bridge between the rank-one approximation of tensors and the eigenvector-dependent nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEPv), and then develop an efficient decoupling algorithm, namely the higher-order self-consistent field (HOSCF) algorithm, inspired by the famous self-consistent field (SCF) iteration frequently used in computational chemistry. The convergence theory of the HOSCF algorithm and an estimation of the convergence speed are further presented. In addition, we propose an improved HOSCF (iHOSCF) algorithm that incorporates the Rayleigh quotient iteration, which can significantly accelerate the convergence of HOSCF. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently converge to the best rank-one approximation of both synthetic and real-world tensors and can scale with high parallel scalability on a modern parallel computer.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-Rex: Text-assisted Retrosynthesis Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14637v1)** | 2024-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a fundamental task in computational chemistry, retrosynthesis prediction aims to identify a set of reactants to synthesize a target molecule. Existing template-free approaches only consider the graph structures of the target molecule, which often cannot generalize well to rare reaction types and large molecules. Here, we propose T-Rex, a text-assisted retrosynthesis prediction approach that exploits pre-trained text language models, such as ChatGPT, to assist the generation of reactants. T-Rex first exploits ChatGPT to generate a description for the target molecule and rank candidate reaction centers based both the description and the molecular graph. It then re-ranks these candidates by querying the descriptions for each reactants and examines which group of reactants can best synthesize the target molecule. We observed that T-Rex substantially outperformed graph-based state-of-the-art approaches on two datasets, indicating the effectiveness of considering text information. We further found that T-Rex outperformed the variant that only use ChatGPT-based description without the re-ranking step, demonstrate how our framework outperformed a straightforward integration of ChatGPT and graph information. Collectively, we show that text generated by pre-trained language models can substantially improve retrosynthesis prediction, opening up new avenues for exploiting ChatGPT to advance computational chemistry. And the codes can be found at https://github.com/lauyikfung/T-Rex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Driven Generative Framework for Molecular Conformation Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09451v2)** | 2024-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of deducing three-dimensional molecular configurations from their two-dimensional graph representations holds paramount importance in the fields of computational chemistry and pharmaceutical development. The rapid advancement of machine learning, particularly within the domain of deep generative networks, has revolutionized the precision of predictive modeling in this context. Traditional approaches often adopt a two-step strategy: initially estimating interatomic distances and subsequently refining the spatial molecular structure by solving a distance geometry problem. However, this sequential approach occasionally falls short in accurately capturing the intricacies of local atomic arrangements, thereby compromising the fidelity of the resulting structural models. Addressing these limitations, this research introduces a cutting-edge generative framework named DDGF. This framework is grounded in the principles of diffusion observed in classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics. DDGF views atoms as discrete entities and excels in guiding the reversal of diffusion, transforming a distribution of stochastic noise back into coherent molecular structures through a process akin to a Markov chain. This transformation commences with the initial representation of a molecular graph in an abstract latent space, culminating in the realization of three-dimensional structures via a sophisticated bilevel optimization scheme meticulously tailored to meet the specific requirements of the task. One of the formidable challenges in this modeling endeavor involves preserving roto-translational invariance to ensure that the generated molecular conformations adhere to the laws of physics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm the efficacy of the proposed DDGF in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Micro-Macro Consistency in Multiscale Modeling: Score-Based Model Assisted Sampling of Fast/Slow Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05715v2)** | 2023-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A valuable step in the modeling of multiscale dynamical systems in fields such as computational chemistry, biology, materials science and more, is the representative sampling of the phase space over long timescales of interest; this task is not, however, without challenges. For example, the long term behavior of a system with many degrees of freedom often cannot be efficiently computationally explored by direct dynamical simulation; such systems can often become trapped in local free energy minima. In the study of physics-based multi-time-scale dynamical systems, techniques have been developed for enhancing sampling in order to accelerate exploration beyond free energy barriers. On the other hand, in the field of Machine Learning, a generic goal of generative models is to sample from a target density, after training on empirical samples from this density. Score based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art capabilities in generating plausible data from target training distributions. Conditional implementations of such generative models have been shown to exhibit significant parallels with long-established -- and physics based -- solutions to enhanced sampling. These physics-based methods can then be enhanced through coupling with the ML generative models, complementing the strengths and mitigating the weaknesses of each technique. In this work, we show that that SGMs can be used in such a coupling framework to improve sampling in multiscale dynamical systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Compressive Fourier collocation methods for high-dimensional diffusion equations with periodic boundary conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01255v5)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are a popular mathematical modelling tool, with applications ranging from finance to computational chemistry. However, standard numerical techniques for solving these PDEs are typically affected by the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we tackle this challenge while focusing on stationary diffusion equations defined over a high-dimensional domain with periodic boundary conditions. Inspired by recent progress in sparse function approximation in high dimensions, we propose a new method called compressive Fourier collocation. Combining ideas from compressive sensing and spectral collocation, our method replaces the use of structured collocation grids with Monte Carlo sampling and employs sparse recovery techniques, such as orthogonal matching pursuit and $\ell^1$ minimization, to approximate the Fourier coefficients of the PDE solution. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that the approximation error of the proposed method is comparable with the best $s$-term approximation (with respect to the Fourier basis) to the solution. Using the recently introduced framework of random sampling in bounded Riesz systems, our analysis shows that the compressive Fourier collocation method mitigates the curse of dimensionality with respect to the number of collocation points under sufficient conditions on the regularity of the diffusion coefficient. We also present numerical experiments that illustrate the accuracy and stability of the method for the approximation of sparse and compressible solutions.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |
