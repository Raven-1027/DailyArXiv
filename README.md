| **[GraphFaaS: Serverless GNN Inference for Burst-Resilient, Real-Time Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10554v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Provenance-based intrusion detection is an increasingly popular application of graphical machine learning in cybersecurity, where system activities are modeled as provenance graphs to capture causality and correlations among potentially malicious actions. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in this setting. However, traditional statically-provisioned GNN inference architectures fall short in meeting two crucial demands of intrusion detection: (1) maintaining consistently low detection latency, and (2) handling highly irregular and bursty workloads. To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations. Preliminary evaluation shows GraphFaaS reduces average detection latency by 85% and coefficient of variation (CV) by 64% compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ML For Systems workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Zoom Networks: Distance Regression and Continuous Depth for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action localization requires both precise boundary detection and computational efficiency. Current methods apply uniform computation across all temporal positions, wasting resources on easy boundaries while struggling with ambiguous ones. We address this through two complementary innovations: Boundary Distance Regression (BDR), which replaces classification-based boundary detection with signed-distance regression achieving 3.3--16.7$\times$ lower variance; and Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR), which allocates transformer depth continuously ($τ\in[0,1]$) to concentrate computation near difficult boundaries. On THUMOS14, our method achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 and 58.2\% average mAP@[0.3:0.7] with 151G FLOPs, using 36\% fewer FLOPs than ActionFormer++ (55.7\% mAP@0.7 at 235G). Compared to uniform baselines, we achieve +2.9\% mAP@0.7 (+1.8\% avg mAP, 5.4\% relative) with 24\% fewer FLOPs and 29\% lower latency, with particularly strong gains on short actions (+4.2\%, 8.6\% relative). Training requires 1.29$\times$ baseline FLOPs, but this one-time cost is amortized over many inference runs; knowledge distillation further reduces this to 1.1$\times$ while retaining 99.5\% accuracy. Our contributions include: (i) a theoretically-grounded distance formulation with information-theoretic analysis showing optimal variance scaling; (ii) a continuous depth allocation mechanism avoiding discrete routing complexity; and (iii) consistent improvements across four datasets with gains correlating with boundary heterogeneity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Format Matters: The Robustness of Multimodal LLMs in Reviewing Evidence from Tables and Charts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10075v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Cosine Similarity Magnitude-Aware CLIP for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09948v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual inputs. This issue can be attributed to two main biases: text-visual bias, the overreliance on prompts and prior outputs, and co-occurrence bias, spurious correlations between frequently paired objects. We propose Gradient-based Influence-Aware Constrained Decoding (GACD), an inference-based method, that addresses both biases without auxiliary models, and is readily applicable to existing models without finetuning. The core of our approach is bias estimation, which uses first-order Taylor gradients to understand the contribution of individual tokens-visual features and text tokens-to the current output. Based on this analysis, GACD mitigates hallucinations through two components: (1) suppressing spurious visual features correlated with the output objects, and (2) rebalancing cross-modal contributions by strengthening visual features relative to text. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GACD effectively reduces hallucinations and improves the visual grounding of MLLM outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Intersections of Halfspaces under Factorizable Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09832v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ). In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem. Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at COLT 2025</p></details> |
| **[Caption This, Reason That: VLMs Caught in the Middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21538v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding in recent years. Yet, they still lag behind human capabilities in specific visual tasks such as counting or relational reasoning. To understand the underlying limitations, we adopt methodologies from cognitive science, analyzing VLM performance along core cognitive axes: Perception, Attention, and Memory. Using a suite of tasks targeting these abilities, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o. Our analysis reveals distinct cognitive profiles: while advanced models approach ceiling performance on some tasks (e.g. category identification), a significant gap persists, particularly in tasks requiring spatial understanding or selective attention. Investigating the source of these failures and potential methods for improvement, we employ a vision-text decoupling analysis, finding that models struggling with direct visual reasoning show marked improvement when reasoning over their own generated text captions. These experiments reveal a strong need for improved VLM Chain-of-Thought (CoT) abilities, even in models that consistently exceed human performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of targeted fine-tuning on composite visual reasoning tasks and show that fine-tuning smaller VLMs substantially improves core cognitive abilities. While this improvement does not translate to large enhancements on challenging, out-of-distribution benchmarks, we show broadly that VLM performance on our datasets strongly correlates with performance on these other benchmarks. Our work provides a detailed analysis of VLM cognitive strengths and weaknesses and identifies key bottlenecks in simultaneous perception and reasoning while also providing an effective and simple solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by nips 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Implicit Attention Priors for Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04864v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location, the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS) formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.</p></details> | Accepted at 3DV 2026 |
| **[Adjacent-view Transformers for Supervised Surround-view Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07759v4)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation has been widely studied and serves as the fundamental step of 3D perception for robotics and autonomous driving. Though significant progress has been made in monocular depth estimation in the past decades, these attempts are mainly conducted on the KITTI benchmark with only front-view cameras, which ignores the correlations across surround-view cameras. In this paper, we propose an Adjacent-View Transformer for Supervised Surround-view Depth estimation (AVT-SSDepth), to jointly predict the depth maps across multiple surrounding cameras. Specifically, we employ a global-to-local feature extraction module that combines CNN with transformer layers for enriched representations. Further, the adjacent-view attention mechanism is proposed to enable the intra-view and inter-view feature propagation. The former is achieved by the self-attention module within each view, while the latter is realized by the adjacent attention module, which computes the attention across multi-cameras to exchange the multi-scale representations across surroundview feature maps. In addition, AVT-SSDepth has strong crossdataset generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance over existing state-ofthe-art methods on both DDAD and nuScenes datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/XiandaGuo/SSDepth.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Differentially Private Rankings via Outranking Methods and Performance Data Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09120v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline of Operations Research that helps decision-makers in choosing, ranking, or sorting alternatives based on conflicting criteria. Over time, its application has been expanded into dynamic and data-driven domains, such as recommender systems. In these contexts, the availability and handling of personal and sensitive data can play a critical role in the decision-making process. Despite this increased reliance on sensitive data, the integration of privacy mechanisms with MCDM methods is underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated approach that combines MCDM outranking methods with Differential Privacy (DP), safeguarding individual contributions' privacy in ranking problems. This approach relies on a pre-processing step to aggregate multiple user evaluations into a comprehensive performance matrix. The evaluation results show a strong to very strong statistical correlation between the true rankings and their anonymized counterparts, ensuring robust privacy parameter guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in the USB Proceedings of the 22th International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI 2025), Valencia, Spain, September 15--18, 2025, ISBN 978-91-531-0240-3, pp. 21--32</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Visual Perception in Language Models: An Attention Head Analysis Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18108v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual understanding. This impressive leap raises a compelling question: how can language models, initially trained solely on linguistic data, effectively interpret and process visual content? This paper aims to address this question with systematic investigation across 4 model families and 4 model scales, uncovering a unique class of attention heads that focus specifically on visual content. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the behavior of these attention heads, the distribution of attention weights, and their concentration on visual tokens within the input. These findings enhance our understanding of how LLMs adapt to multimodal tasks, demonstrating their potential to bridge the gap between textual and visual understanding. This work paves the way for the development of AI systems capable of engaging with diverse modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Information-Minimal Geometry for Qubit-Efficient Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08362v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Qubit-efficient optimization seeks to represent an $N$-variable combinatorial problem within a Hilbert space smaller than $2^N$, using only as much quantum structure as the objective itself requires. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\lceil\log_2 N\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary.</p></details> | 39 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Non-Aligned Reference Image Quality Assessment for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08155v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the perceptual quality of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) images remains a key challenge, particularly in the absence of pixel-aligned ground truth references. Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS. We find strong correlation between our proposed quality prediction model and the collected subjective ratings.

| **[GMM with Many Weak Moment Conditions and Nuisance Parameters: General Theory and Applications to Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07295v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weak identification arises in many statistical problems when key variables exhibit weak correlations-for example, when instrumental variables correlate weakly with treatment, or when proxy variables correlate weakly with unmeasured confounders. Under weak identification, standard estimation methods such as the generalized method of moments (GMM) can produce substantial bias, both in finite samples and asymptotically. This challenge is compounded in modern applications that require estimating many nuisance parameters. This paper develops a framework for estimation and inference of a finite-dimensional target parameter in general moment models with the number of weak moment conditions and nuisance parameters growing with sample size. We analyze a general two-step debiasing estimator that accommodates flexible, possibly nonparametric first-step estimation of nuisance parameters, in which Neyman orthogonality plays a more critical role in obtaining debiased inference than in conventional settings with strong identification. Under a many-weak-moment asymptotic regime, we establish the estimator's consistency and asymptotic normality. We provide high-level conditions for the general setting and demonstrate their application to two important special cases: inference with weak instruments and inference with weak proxies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reference-Guided Verdict: LLMs-as-Judges in Automatic Evaluation of Free-Form QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09235v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as chat assistants capable of generating human-like conversations has amplified the need for robust evaluation methods, particularly for open-ended tasks. Conventional metrics such as EM and F1, while useful, are inadequate for capturing the full semantics and contextual depth of such generative outputs. We propose a reference-guided verdict method that automates the evaluation process by leveraging multiple LLMs as judges. Through experiments on free-form question-answering tasks, we demonstrate that combining multiple models improves the reliability and accuracy of evaluations, especially in tasks where a single model may struggle. The results indicate a strong correlation with human evaluations, establishing the proposed method as a reliable alternative to traditional metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 9th Widening NLP Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Online Combinatorial Optimization with Graphical Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16031v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing work in online stochastic combinatorial optimization assumes that inputs are drawn from independent distributions -- a strong assumption that often fails in practice. At the other extreme, arbitrary correlations are equivalent to worst-case inputs via Yao's minimax principle, making good algorithms often impossible. This motivates the study of intermediate models that capture mild correlations while still permitting non-trivial algorithms. In this paper, we study online combinatorial optimization under Markov Random Fields (MRFs), a well-established graphical model for structured dependencies. MRFs parameterize correlation strength via the maximum weighted degree $Δ$, smoothly interpolating between independence ($Δ= 0$) and full correlation ($Δ\to \infty$). While naïvely this yields $e^{O(Δ)}$-competitive algorithms and $Ω(Δ)$ hardness, we ask: when can we design tight $Θ(Δ)$-competitive algorithms? We present general techniques achieving $O(Δ)$-competitive algorithms for both minimization and maximization problems under MRF-distributed inputs. For minimization problems with coverage constraints (e.g., Facility Location and Steiner Tree), we reduce to the well-studied $p$-sample model. For maximization problems (e.g., matchings and combinatorial auctions with XOS buyers), we extend the "balanced prices" framework for online allocation problems to MRFs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Convolution for CNN-based Speech Enhancement Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14224v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based speech enhancement methods have significantly improved speech quality and intelligibility. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proven to be essential components of many high-performance models. In this paper, we introduce adaptive convolution, an efficient and versatile convolutional module that enhances the model's capability to adaptively represent speech signals. Adaptive convolution performs frame-wise causal dynamic convolution, generating time-varying kernels for each frame by assembling multiple parallel candidate kernels. A lightweight attention mechanism is proposed for adaptive convolution, leveraging both current and historical information to assign adaptive weights to each candidate kernel. This enables the convolution operation to adapt to frame-level speech spectral features, leading to more efficient extraction and reconstruction. We integrate adaptive convolution into various CNN-based models, highlighting its generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that adaptive convolution significantly improves the performance with negligible increases in computational complexity, especially for lightweight models. Moreover, we present an intuitive analysis revealing a strong correlation between kernel selection and signal characteristics. Furthermore, we propose the adaptive convolutional recurrent network (AdaptCRN), an ultra-lightweight model that incorporates adaptive convolution and an efficient encoder-decoder design, achieving superior performance compared to models with similar or even higher computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing</p></details> |
| **[Error exponents of quantum state discrimination with composite correlated hypotheses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12901v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and identically distributed case to encompass composite correlated hypotheses. In particular, we introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their equivalence or quantitative relations. In the error exponent regime, we generalize the quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum states, demonstrating that the optimal Type-I error exponent, under an exponential constraint on the Type-II error, is precisely characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong converse exponent regime, we provide a general lower bound on the exponent in terms of the regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence and a matching upper bound when the null hypothesis is a singleton. The generality of these results enables applications in various contexts, including (i) refining the generalized quantum Stein's lemma by [Fang, Fawzi & Fawzi, 2024]; (ii) exhibiting counterexamples to the continuity of the regularized Petz Rényi divergence and Hoeffding divergence; (iii) obtaining error exponents for adversarial channel discrimination and resource detection problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: s...</summary><p>v2: strengthen error exponent to limit superior, add upper bound to strong converse exponent, add more applications</p></details> |
| **[Place Matters: Comparing LLM Hallucination Rates for Place-Based Legal Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06700v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do we make a meaningful comparison of a large language model's knowledge of the law in one place compared to another? Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts.</p></details> |  |
| **[multiMentalRoBERTa: A Fine-tuned Multiclass Classifier for Mental Health Disorder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04698v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps, revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category. Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods, domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup (excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts, while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental health platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Big Data, 8-11 December, 2025 @ Macau SAR, China</p></details> |
| **[Low-altitude UAV Friendly-Jamming for Satellite-Maritime Communications via Generative AI-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15468v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can be used to assist maritime wireless communications for wide-area data transmission. However, the extensive coverage of LEO satellites, combined with the openness of channels, can cause the communication process to suffer from security risks. This paper presents a LEO satellite-maritime communication system assisted by low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) friendly-jamming to ensure data security at the physical layer. Since such a system requires balancing the conflicting performance metrics of secrecy rate and energy consumption of the UAV to meet evolving scenario demands, we formulate a secure satellite-maritime communication multi-objective optimization problem (SSMCMOP). In order to solve the dynamic and long-term optimization problem, we reformulate it into a Markov decision process. We then propose a transformer-enhanced soft actor-critic (TransSAC) algorithm, which is a generative artificial intelligence-enabled deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the reformulated problem, thus capturing strong temporal correlations and diversely exploring weights. Simulation results demonstrate that the TransSAC algorithm outperforms comparative approaches and algorithms, maximizing the secrecy rate while effectively minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV. Moreover, the results identify more suitable constraints for the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing Expert Opinion from Social Media for Stock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10078v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While stock prediction task traditionally relies on volume-price and fundamental data to predict the return ratio or price movement trend, sentiment factors derived from social media platforms such as StockTwits offer a complementary and useful source of real-time market information. However, we find that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they reflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy nature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm that filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse experts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our approach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification methods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert predictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert identification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal sparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations in our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention neural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related stocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly increasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated expert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but also work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined signals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all quant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and correlation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies. We hope this work inspires further research into leveraging social media data for enhancing quantitative investment strategies.

| **[A Low-Rank Method for Vision Language Model Hallucination Mitigation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06496v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous driving to help understand traffic scenes, but they sometimes produce hallucinations, which are false details not grounded in the visual input. Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism. Additionally, our method, which can be easily parallelized, reduces inference time by 51-67% compared to debate approaches, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $τ_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($τ_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($τ_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ML4H 2025 Proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However, there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory of univariate function approximation. By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely, its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Large model retrieval enhancement framework for construction site risk identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02073v2)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses construction site hazard identification by proposing a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) without requiring fine-tuning. Current LLM-based approaches face limitations: image-text matching struggles with complex hazards, while instruction tuning lacks generalization and is resource-intensive. Our method dynamically integrates external knowledge and retrieved similar cases via prompt tuning, overcoming LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge and feature correlation. The framework comprises a case database, an image retrieval module, and an LLM-based reasoning module. Evaluated on real-site data, our approach boosted GLM-4V's accuracy to 50%, a 35.49% improvement over baselines, with consistent gains across hazard types. Ablation studies validated the effectiveness of our image retrieval strategy, showing the superiority of our LPIPS- and CLIP-based method. The proposed technique significantly improves identification accuracy and contextual understanding, demonstrating strong generalization and offering a practical path for intelligent safety risk detection in construction.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[An Efficient Gradient-Aware Error-Bounded Lossy Compressor for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05770v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, but its deployment is often constrained by the communication cost of transmitting gradients between clients and the central server, especially under system heterogeneity where low-bandwidth clients bottleneck overall performance. Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss. Integrated into a real-world FL framework, APPFL, it reduces end-to-end communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under various constrained-bandwidth scenarios, demonstrating strong scalability for real-world FL deployments.</p></details> | Preprint version |
| **[On Text Simplification Metrics and General-Purpose LLMs for Accessible Health Information, and A Potential Architectural Advantage of The Instruction-Tuned LLM class](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05080v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46), while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability, discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary domain-adaptation issue for simplification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Multimodal Perception in Large Language Models Through Perceptual Strength Ratings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06980v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigated whether multimodal large language models can achieve human-like sensory grounding by examining their ability to capture perceptual strength ratings across sensory modalities. We explored how model characteristics (size, multimodal capabilities, architectural generation) influence grounding performance, distributional factor dependencies (word frequency, embeddings, feature distances), and human-model processing differences. We evaluated 21 models from four families (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Qwen) using 3,611 words from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms through correlation, distance metrics, and qualitative analysis. Results showed that larger (6 out of 8 comparisons), multimodal (5 of 7), and newer models (5 of 8) generally outperformed their smaller, text-based, and older counterparts. Top models achieved 85-90% accuracy and 0.58-0.65 correlations with human ratings, demonstrating substantial similarity. Moreover, distributional factors showed minimal impact, not exceeding human dependency levels. However, despite strong alignment, models were not identical to humans, as even top performers showed differences in distance and correlation measures, with qualitative analysis revealing processing patterns related to absent sensory grounding. Additionally, it remains questionable whether introducing multimodality resolves this grounding deficit. Although multimodality improved performance, it seems to provide similar information as massive text rather than qualitatively different data, as benefits occurred across unrelated sensory dimensions and massive text-only models achieved comparable results. Our findings demonstrate that while advanced LLMs can approximate human sensory-linguistic associations through statistical learning, they still differ from human embodied cognition in processing mechanisms, even with multimodal integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |

In 2024, Starlink, in partnership with T-Mobile, began beta testing an SMS-only Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) service. This marks the first large-scale deployment of Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, allowing unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations. This paper presents the first measurement study of deployed DS2D technologies. Using crowdsourced mobile network data from the U.S. between October 2024 and July 2025, we provide evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and future evolution of DS2D technologies for extending mobile connectivity. We find a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed, the number of unique cell identifiers measured, and the volume of measurements, concentrated in accessible areas with poor terrestrial network coverage, such as national parks and sparsely populated counties. Stable physical-layer measurements were observed throughout the period, with a 24-dB lower median RSRP and a 3-dB higher RSRQ compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on the SINR measurements collected, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 3 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 18 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory and business decisions, including allowable out-of-band emissions, permitted number of satellites, and availability of spectrum and orbital resources.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELECTRA: A Cartesian Network for 3D Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using floating orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing concept in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks. Furthermore, ELECTRA is able to lower the compute time required to arrive at converged DFT solutions - initializing calculations using our predicted densities yields an average 50.72 \% reduction in self-consistent field (SCF) iterations on unseen molecules.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Path Signatures Enable Model-Free Mapping of RNA Modifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08855v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting chemical modifications on RNA molecules remains a key challenge in epitranscriptomics. Traditional reverse transcription-based sequencing methods introduce enzyme- and sequence-dependent biases and fragment RNA molecules, confounding the accurate mapping of modifications across the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing offers a powerful alternative by preserving native RNA molecules, enabling the detection of modifications at single-molecule resolution. However, current computational tools can identify only a limited subset of modification types within well-characterized sequence contexts for which ample training data exists. Here, we introduce a model-free computational method that reframes modification detection as an anomaly detection problem, requiring only canonical (unmodified) RNA reads without any other annotated data. For each nanopore read, our approach extracts robust, modification-sensitive features from the raw ionic current signal at a site using the signature transform, then computes an anomaly score by comparing the resulting feature vector to its nearest neighbors in an unmodified reference dataset. We convert anomaly scores into statistical p-values to enable anomaly detection at both individual read and site levels. Validation on densely-modified \textit{E. coli} rRNA demonstrates that our approach detects known sites harboring diverse modification types, without prior training on these modifications. We further applyied this framework to dengue virus (DENV) transcripts and mammalian mRNAs. For DENV sfRNA, it led to revealing a novel 2'-O-methylated site, which we validate orthogonally by qRT-PCR assays. These results demonstrate that our model-free approach operates robustly across different types of RNAs and datasets generated with different nanopore sequencing chemistries.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.</p></details> | Technique Report |

This challenge proves especially acute in chemistry, where superficial correctness masks deeper errors in molecular structure, reaction mechanisms, and synthetic pathways. We present a systematic approach combining a reasoning-centric model architecture (Magistral Small) with Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dual-domain dataset covering molecular properties and chemical transformations. Evaluation reveals substantial improvements: the fine-tuned system achieves 96.3% format adherence, 97.4% chemical validity, and 74.4% synthesis feasibility. Comparative analysis shows our approach outperforms specialized translation models like MolT5 (97.4% vs 77.2% validity) while achieving performance comparable to complex tool-augmented systems like ChemCrow (9.0/10 vs 9.24/10 expert rating) through a more transparent, efficient methodology. Results demonstrate a learning hierarchy where syntactic correctness develops before chemical understanding, which precedes synthetic planning capability.

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) offers a systematic framework that integrates data-driven inference with physical constraints, resulting in models that are accurate, mechanistic, generalizable, and able to extrapolate beyond observed domains. This review surveys recent advances in physics-informed neural networks and operator learning, differentiable molecular simulation, and hybrid physics-ML potentials, with emphasis on long-timescale kinetics, rare events, and free-energy estimation. We frame these approaches as solutions to the "biomolecular closure problem", recovering unresolved interactions beyond classical force fields while preserving thermodynamic consistency and mechanistic interpretability. We examine theoretical foundations, tools and frameworks, computational trade-offs, and unresolved issues, including model expressiveness and stability. We outline prospective research avenues at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and computational chemistry, contending that future advancements will depend on mechanistic inductive biases, and integrated differentiable physical learning frameworks for biomolecular simulation and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Reaction Prediction via Interaction Modeling of Symmetric Difference Shingle Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06356v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.</p></details> |  |

This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 4 figures.

| **[SigmaDock: Untwisting Molecular Docking With Fragment-Based SE(3) Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04854v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods, but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates (RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8% reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of deep learning for molecular modelling.</p></details> | Preprint |

This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning.

A simple solution would be to translate Bangla questions into English first and then use these models. However, existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with technical terms. They often mistranslate specialized vocabulary, which changes the meaning of the problem and leads to wrong answers. We present BanglaSTEM, a dataset of 5,000 carefully selected Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM fields including computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. We generated over 12,000 translations using language models and then used human evaluators to select the highest quality pairs that preserve technical terminology correctly. We train a T5-based translation model on BanglaSTEM and test it on two tasks: generating code and solving math problems. Our results show significant improvements in translation accuracy for technical content, making it easier for Bangla speakers to use English-focused language models effectively. Both the BanglaSTEM dataset and the trained translation model are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/reyazul/BanglaSTEM-T5.</p></details> |  |

While serial algorithms for constructing these entities are well-established, parallel construction remains challenging. This is especially true in distributed memory systems, where each host manages only a subset of the input points. This process requires redistributing points across hosts and accurately computing the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed construction algorithm, which is implemented in our open-source C++ 3-dimensional Voronoi construction framework. Our approach leverages Delaunay triangulation as an intermediate step, which is then transformed into a Voronoi diagram. We introduce the algorithms we implemented for the precise construction and our load-balancing approach and compare the running time with other state-of-the-art frameworks. MadVoro is a versatile tool that can be applied in various scientific domains, such as mesh decomposition, computational physics, chemistry, and machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in RASTI (RAS Techniques and Instruments) in September 2025</p></details> |
| **[E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19216v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuromorphic Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11940v4)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike conventional digital approaches, which suffer from the Von Neumann bottleneck and depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from a wide range of disciplines -- including artificial intelligence, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, cognitive science and materials science -- neuromorphic computing promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 3 boxes</p></details> |
| **[A GPU-based Compressible Combustion Solver for Applications Exhibiting Disparate Space and Time Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23993v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-speed chemically active flows present significant computational challenges due to their disparate space and time scales, where stiff chemistry often dominates simulation time. While modern supercomputing scientific codes achieve exascale performance by leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs), existing GPU-based compressible combustion solvers face critical limitations in memory management, load balancing, and handling the highly localized nature of chemical reactions. To this end, we present a high-performance compressible reacting flow solver built on the AMReX framework and optimized for multi-GPU settings. Our approach addresses three GPU performance bottlenecks: memory access patterns through column-major storage optimization, computational workload variability via a bulk-sparse integration strategy for chemical kinetics, and multi-GPU load distribution for adaptive mesh refinement applications. The solver adapts existing matrix-based chemical kinetics formulations to multigrid contexts. Using representative combustion applications including hydrogen-air detonations and jet in supersonic crossflow configurations, we demonstrate $2-5\times$ performance improvements over initial GPU implementations with near-ideal weak scaling across $1-96$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Roofline analysis reveals substantial improvements in arithmetic intensity for both convection ($\sim 10 \times$) and chemistry ($\sim 4 \times$) routines, confirming efficient utilization of GPU memory bandwidth and computational resources.</p></details> | 32 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Spectral Neural Graph Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27474v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics, Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The 19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3 30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across architectural diversity. The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analytic Theory of Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22481v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm is one of the most promising variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), bridging the current era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices and the future of fully fault-tolerant quantum computing. Although practical demonstrations of QITE and its potential advantages over the general VQA trained with vanilla gradient descent (GD) in certain tasks have been reported, a first-principle, theoretical understanding of QITE remains limited. Here, we aim to develop an analytic theory for the dynamics of QITE. First, we show that QITE can be interpreted as a form of a general VQA trained with Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNGD), where the inverse quantum Fisher information matrix serves as the learning-rate tensor. This equivalence is established not only at the level of gradient update rules, but also through the action principle: the variational principle can be directly connected to the geometric geodesic distance in the quantum Fisher information metric, up to an integration constant. Second, for wide quantum neural networks, we employ the quantum neural tangent kernel framework to construct an analytic model for QITE. We prove that QITE always converges faster than GD-based VQA, though this advantage is suppressed by the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension. This helps explain certain experimental results in quantum computational chemistry. Our theory encompasses linear, quadratic, and more general loss functions. We validate the analytic results through numerical simulations. Our findings establish a theoretical foundation for QITE dynamics and provide analytic insights for the first-principle design of variational quantum algorithms.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |
| **[The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11569v6)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, has revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically constrained approach, suggesting that directly predicting the forces yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, and that energy conservation can be learned during training. This work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Given the difficulty in monitoring and correcting the lack of energy conservation, direct forces should be used with great care. We show that the best approach to exploit the acceleration they afford is to use them in conjunction with conservative forces. A model can be pre-trained efficiently on direct forces, then fine-tuned using backpropagation. At evaluation time, both force types can be used together to avoid unphysical effects while still benefitting almost entirely from the computational efficiency of direct forces.</p></details> | ICML 2025 (Oral) |
| **[Fast Non-Log-Concave Sampling under Nonconvex Equality and Inequality Constraints with Landing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22044v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $Σ\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $Σ$, OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target density $ρ_Σ(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))dσ_Σ$. Lastly, through experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.</p></details> | 62 pages |

Recent work has explored training neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the \emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and scalable tools for machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Generalised Flow Maps for Few-Step Generative Modelling on Riemannian Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21608v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data. Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods: Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows, to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Neural Graduated Assignment for Maximum Common Edge Subgraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12325v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem is a crucial challenge with significant implications in domains such as biology and chemistry. Traditional approaches, which include transformations into max-clique and search-based algorithms, suffer from scalability issues when dealing with larger instances. This paper introduces ``Neural Graduated Assignment'' (NGA), a simple, scalable, unsupervised-training-based method that addresses these limitations. Central to NGA is stacking of differentiable assignment optimization with neural components, enabling high-dimensional parameterization of the matching process through a learnable temperature mechanism. We further theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of NGA, showing its design leads to fast convergence, better exploration-exploitation tradeoff, and ability to escape local optima. Extensive experiments across MCES computation, graph similarity estimation, and graph retrieval tasks reveal that NGA not only significantly improves computation time and scalability on large instances but also enhances performance compared to existing methodologies. The introduction of NGA marks a significant advancement in the computation of MCES and offers insights into other assignment problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Discovery and Exploration in Chemical Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18900v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of atomistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties from molecular structures underpins materials innovation. Existing computational and experimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate chemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled datasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse application domains. Here we develop MIST, a family of molecular foundation models with up to an order of magnitude more parameters and data than prior works. Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse range of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400 structure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and quantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve real-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte solvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction, stereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and multi-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using mechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends not explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn generalizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized Bayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of model development by an order of magnitude. The methods and findings presented here represent a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery, design, and optimization using foundation models and provide valuable guidance for training compute-optimal scientific foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main manuscript: 28 pages (including references), 7 tables and 5 figures.

We position Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm, where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency. Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives -- process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i) trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a domain-oriented synthesis of autonomous scientific discovery and positions Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications such as ChatGPT have shown the capability of generating human-like conversation on extensive topics. Due to the impressive performance on a variety of language-related tasks (e.g., open-domain question answering, translation, and document summarization), one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by the LLMs with broader real-world applications (e.g., customer service, education and accessibility, and scientific discovery). Inspired by their success, this paper will offer an overview of state-of-the-art LLMs and their integration into a wide range of academic disciplines, including: (1) arts, letters, and law (e.g., history, philosophy, political science, arts and architecture, law), (2) economics and business (e.g., finance, economics, accounting, marketing), and (3) science and engineering (e.g., mathematics, physics and mechanical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, life sciences and bioengineering, earth sciences and civil engineering, computer science and electrical engineering). Integrating humanity and technology, in this paper, we will explore how LLMs are shaping research and practice in these fields, while also discussing key limitations, open challenges, and future directions in the era of generative AI. The review of how LLMs are engaged across disciplines-along with key observations and insights-can help researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting LLMs to advance their works in diverse real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects the author metadata and refines the paper's title.

We present a systematic, reproducible benchmark comparing quantum and classical machine learning models for BDE prediction using a chemically curated feature set encompassing atomic properties (atomic numbers, hybridization), bond characteristics (bond order, type), and local environmental descriptors. Our quantum framework, implemented in Qiskit Aer on six qubits, employs ZZFeatureMap encodings with variational ansatz (RealAmplitudes) across multiple architectures Variational Quantum Regressors (VQR), Quantum Support Vector Regressors (QSVR), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), and Quantum Random Forests (QRF). These are rigorously benchmarked against strong classical baselines, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Comprehensive evaluation spanning absolute and relative error metrics, threshold accuracies, and error distributions shows that top-performing quantum models (QCNN, QRF) match the predictive accuracy and robustness of classical ensembles and deep networks, particularly within the chemically prevalent mid-range BDE regime. These findings establish a transparent baseline for quantum-enhanced molecular property prediction and outline a practical foundation for advancing quantum computational chemistry toward near chemical accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum matrix arithmetics with Hamiltonian evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06316v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</p></details> | 94 pages, 13 figures |

A Unified Empirical Study on Atomistic Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05583v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN - that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 8 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

Traditional quantum chemistry methods based on the harmonic approximation neglect anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, while ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) remains computationally expensive. Here, we integrate our deep equivariant tensor attention network (DetaNet) with a velocity-Verlet integrator to enable fast and accurate machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations for spectral prediction. Trained on the QMe14S dataset containing energies, forces, dipole moments, and polarizabilities for 186,102 small organic molecules, DetaNet yields a universal and transferable force field with high-order tensor prediction capability. Using time-correlation functions derived from MLMD and ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) trajectories, we computed IR and Raman spectra that accurately reproduce anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects. Benchmark tests on isolated molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, demonstrate that the DetaNet-based MD approach achieves near-experimental spectral accuracy with speedups up to three orders of magnitude over AIMD. Furthermore, the framework extends seamlessly to molecular and inorganic crystals, molecular aggregates, and biological macromolecules such as polypeptides with minimal fine-tuning. In all systems, DetaNet maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Overall, this work establishes a universal machine learning force field and tensor-aware MLMD framework that enable fast, accurate, and broadly applicable dynamic simulations and IR/Raman spectral predictions across diverse molecular and material systems.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

To fill this blank, we propose QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry oriented benchmark comprising 350 computational chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields, which contains analytical chemistry, bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry. To systematically evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), they are categorized into three tiers: easy, medium, and difficult. Each problem, rooted in realistic chemical scenarios, is structured to prevent heuristic shortcuts and demand explicit numerical reasoning. QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork for future improvements such as domain-adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal integration.
