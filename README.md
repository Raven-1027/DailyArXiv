| **[Pitch Estimation With Mean Averaging Smoothed Product Spectrum And Musical Consonance Evaluation Using MASP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06625v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces Mean Averaging Smoothed Product (MASP) Spectrum, which is a modified version of the Harmonic Product Spectrum, designed to enhance pitch estimation for many algorithm-wise deceptive frequency spectra that still lead clear pitches, for both harmonic and inharmonic cases. By introducing a global mean based smoothing for spectrum, the MASP algorithm diminishes the unwanted sensitivity of HPS for spectra with missing partials. The method exhibited robust pitch estimations consistent with perceptual expectations. Motivated upon the strong correlation between consonance and periodicity, the same algorithm is extended and, with the proposition of a harmonicity measure (H), used to evaluate musical consonance for two and three tones; yielding consonance hierarchies that align with perception and practice of music theory. These findings suggest that perception of pitch and consonance may share a similar underlying mechanism that depend on spectrum.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDQM: Synthetic Data Quality Metric for Object Detection Dataset Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06596v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data. The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution, enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at https://github.com/ayushzenith/SDQM</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Routing in Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04694v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the key to scaling modern LLMs, yet little is understood about how their sparse routing dynamics respond to multilingual data. In this work, we analyze expert routing patterns using parallel multilingual datasets and present highly interpretable layer-wise phenomena. We find that MoE models route tokens in language-specific ways in the early and late decoder layers but exhibit significant cross-lingual routing alignment in middle layers, mirroring parameter-sharing trends observed in dense LLMs. In particular, we reveal a clear, strong correlation between a model's performance in a given language and how similarly its tokens are routed to English in these layers. Extending beyond correlation, we explore inference-time interventions that induce higher cross-lingual routing alignment. We introduce a method that steers the router by promoting middle-layer task experts frequently activated in English, and it successfully increases multilingual performance. These 1-2% gains are remarkably consistent across two evaluation tasks, three models, and 15+ languages, especially given that these simple interventions override routers of extensively trained, state-of-the-art LLMs. In comparison, interventions outside of the middle layers or targeting multilingual-specialized experts only yield performance degradation. Altogether, we present numerous findings that explain how MoEs process non-English text and demonstrate that generalization is limited by the model's ability to leverage language-universal experts in all languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[MobRT: A Digital Twin-Based Framework for Scalable Learning in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04592v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotics have been largely driven by imitation learning, which depends critically on large-scale, high-quality demonstration data. However, collecting such data remains a significant challenge-particularly for mobile manipulators, which must coordinate base locomotion and arm manipulation in high-dimensional, dynamic, and partially observable environments. Consequently, most existing research remains focused on simpler tabletop scenarios, leaving mobile manipulation relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{MobRT}, a digital twin-based framework designed to simulate two primary categories of complex, whole-body tasks: interaction with articulated objects (e.g., opening doors and drawers) and mobile-base pick-and-place operations. \textit{MobRT} autonomously generates diverse and realistic demonstrations through the integration of virtual kinematic control and whole-body motion planning, enabling coherent and physically consistent execution. We evaluate the quality of \textit{MobRT}-generated data across multiple baseline algorithms, establishing a comprehensive benchmark and demonstrating a strong correlation between task success and the number of generated trajectories. Experiments integrating both simulated and real-world demonstrations confirm that our approach markedly improves policy generalization and performance, achieving robust results in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLOWR.root: A flow matching based foundation model for joint multi-purpose structure-aware 3D ligand generation and affinity prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02578v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present FLOWR:root, an equivariant flow-matching model for pocket-aware 3D ligand generation with joint binding affinity prediction and confidence estimation. The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50, pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific adaptation. FLOWR:root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, FLOWR:root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2$\alpha$ ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ER$\alpha$ and TYK2 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling, FLOWR:root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design spanning hit identification through lead optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Law of Vision Representation in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16357v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the "Law of Vision Representation" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It reveals a strong correlation between the combination of cross-modal alignment, correspondence in vision representation, and MLLM performance. We quantify the two factors using the cross-modal Alignment and Correspondence score (AC score). Through extensive experiments involving thirteen different vision representation settings and evaluations across eight benchmarks, we find that the AC score is linearly correlated to model performance. By leveraging this relationship, we are able to identify and train the optimal vision representation only, which does not require finetuning the language model every time, resulting in a 99.7% reduction in computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/Law_of_Vision_Representation_in_MLLMs</p></details> |
| **[PatentMind: A Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph for Patent Similarity Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19347v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries, and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG). PatentMind decomposes patents into their three dimensions of technical features, application domains, and claim scopes, then dimension-specific similarity scores are calculated over the MARG. These scores are dynamically weighted through a context-aware reasoning process, which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment. To support evaluation, we construct a human-annotated benchmark PatentSimBench, comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the PatentMind-generated scores show a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations, significantly outperforming embedding-based models, patent-specific models, and advanced prompt engineering methods. Beyond computational linguistics, our framework provides a structured and semantically grounded foundation for real-world decision-making, particularly for tasks such as infringement risk assessment, underscoring its broader impact on both patent analytics and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[StereoFoley: Object-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18272v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Filters to VLMs: Benchmarking Defogging Methods through Object Detection and Segmentation Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03906v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent Reference-free Automated Evaluation of Open-Ended User Survey Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06242v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-ended survey responses provide valuable insights in marketing research, but low-quality responses not only burden researchers with manual filtering but also risk leading to misleading conclusions, underscoring the need for effective evaluation. Existing automatic evaluation methods target LLM-generated text and inadequately assess human-written responses with their distinct characteristics. To address such characteristics, we propose a two-stage evaluation framework specifically designed for human survey responses. First, gibberish filtering removes nonsensical responses. Then, three dimensions-effort, relevance, and completeness-are evaluated using LLM capabilities, grounded in empirical analysis of real-world survey data. Validation on English and Korean datasets shows that our framework not only outperforms existing metrics but also demonstrates high practical applicability for real-world applications such as response quality prediction and response rejection, showing strong correlations with expert assessment.</p></details> | EMNLP Industry Track |
| **[Round-trip Reinforcement Learning: Self-Consistent Training for Better Chemical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01527v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency. For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable foundation models.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Energy-Regularized Sequential Model Editing on Hyperspheres](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01172v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy (HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically, SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/SPHERE. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.02355 by other authors</p></details> |

In 2024, Starlink, in partnership with T-Mobile, began beta testing an SMS-only Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) service. This marks the first large-scale deployment of Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, allowing unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations. This paper presents the first measurement study of deployed DS2D technologies. Using crowdsourced mobile network data from the U.S. between October 2024 and July 2025, we provide evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and future evolution of DS2D technologies for extending mobile connectivity. We find a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed, the number of unique cell identifiers measured, and the volume of measurements, concentrated in accessible areas with poor terrestrial network coverage, such as national parks and sparsely populated counties. Stable physical-layer measurements were observed throughout the period, with a 24-dB lower median RSRP and a 3-dB higher RSRQ compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on the SINR measurements collected, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 3 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 18 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory and business decisions, including allowable out-of-band emissions, permitted number of satellites, and availability of spectrum and orbital resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

| **[SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking, the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs. We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

| **[Revisit the Imbalance Optimization in Multi-task Learning: An Experimental Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23915v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising, its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis: a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.</p></details> |  |

Hardware compression and decompression processing units (CDPUs) can alleviate this overhead, but optimal algorithm selection, microarchitectural design, and system-level placement of CDPUs are still not well understood. We present the design of an ASIC-based in-storage CDPU and provide a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation against two leading ASIC accelerators, Intel QAT 8970 and QAT 4xxx. The evaluation spans three dominant CDPU placement regimes: peripheral, on-chip, and in-storage. Our results reveal: (i) acute sensitivity of throughput and latency to CDPU placement and interconnection, (ii) strong correlation between compression efficiency and data patterns/layouts, (iii) placement-driven divergences between microbenchmark gains and real-application speedups, (iv) discrepancies between module and system-level power efficiency, and (v) scalability and multi-tenant interference is sues of various CDPUs. These findings motivate a placement-aware, cross-layer rethinking of hardware (de)compression for hyperscale storage infrastructures.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Methods: We introduce Freqformer, a novel Transformer-based model featuring a dual-branch architecture that integrates a Transformer layer for capturing global spatial context with a complex-valued frequency-domain module designed for adaptive frequency enhancement. Freqformer was trained using single depth-plane OCTA images, utilizing volumetrically merged OCTA as the ground truth. Performance was evaluated quantitatively through 2-D and 3-D image quality metrics. 2-D networks and their 3-D counterparts were compared to assess the differences between enhancing volume slice by slice and enhancing it by 3-D patches. Furthermore, 3-D quantitative vascular metrics were conducted to quantify human retinal vasculature. Results: Freqformer substantially outperformed existing convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based methods, achieving superior image metrics. Importantly, the enhanced OCTA volumes show strong correlation with the merged volumes on vascular segment count, density, length, and flow index, further underscoring its reliability for quantitative vascular analysis. 3-D counterparts did not yield additional gains in image metrics or downstream 3-D vascular quantification but incurred nearly an order-of-magnitude longer inference time, supporting our 2-D slice-wise enhancement strategy. Additionally, Freqformer showed excellent generalization capability on larger field-of-view scans, surpassing the quality of conventional volumetric merging methods. Conclusion: Freqformer reliably generates high-definition 3-D retinal microvasculature from single-scan OCTA, enabling precise vascular quantification comparable to standard volumetric merging methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract appearing here is slightly shorter than that in the PDF file.

In this paper, we propose a Token-level Uncertainty estimation framework for Reasoning (TokUR) that enables LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their responses in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation during LLM decoding to generate predictive distributions for token-level uncertainty estimation, and we aggregate these uncertainty quantities to capture the semantic uncertainty of generated responses. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that TokUR exhibits a strong correlation with answer correctness and model robustness, and the uncertainty signals produced by TokUR can be leveraged to enhance the model's reasoning performance at test time. These results highlight the effectiveness of TokUR as a principled and scalable approach for improving the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in challenging reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; Work in progress</p></details> |

To address this, we present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus, were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation, achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available at https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn68544889.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19117v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.</p></details> |  |

Be natively more robust via Aliasing and Spectral Artifact free Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09804v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successful in various computer vision tasks. From an image and signal processing point of view, this success is counter-intuitive, as the inherent spatial pyramid design of most CNNs is apparently violating basic signal processing laws, i.e. the Sampling Theorem in their downsampling operations. This issue has been broadly neglected until recent work in the context of adversarial attacks and distribution shifts showed that there is a strong correlation between the vulnerability of CNNs and aliasing artifacts induced by bandlimit-violating downsampling. As a remedy, we propose an alias-free downsampling operation in the frequency domain, denoted Frequency Low Cut Pooling (FLC Pooling) which we further extend to Aliasing and Sinc Artifact-free Pooling (ASAP). ASAP is alias-free and removes further artifacts from sinc-interpolation. Our experimental evaluation on ImageNet-1k, ImageNet-C and CIFAR datasets on various CNN architectures demonstrates that networks using FLC Pooling and ASAP as downsampling methods learn more stable features as measured by their robustness against common corruptions and adversarial attacks, while maintaining a clean accuracy similar to the respective baseline models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are theoretical mistakes in Section 3.2, where the definition of utility should be fixed.

Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a novel Bayesian scaling law for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling law matches existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT or DPO to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then study ICL on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause suppressed behaviors to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2025 camera-ready version; 9 pages main text, 39 pages total</p></details> |
| **[QASTAnet: A DNN-based Quality Metric for Spatial Audio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16715v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the development of spatial audio technologies, reliable and shared methods for evaluating audio quality are essential. Listening tests are currently the standard but remain costly in terms of time and resources. Several models predicting subjective scores have been proposed, but they do not generalize well to real-world signals. In this paper, we propose QASTAnet (Quality Assessment for SpaTial Audio network), a new metric based on a deep neural network, specialized on spatial audio (ambisonics and binaural). As training data is scarce, we aim for the model to be trainable with a small amount of data. To do so, we propose to rely on expert modeling of the low-level auditory system and use a neurnal network to model the high-level cognitive function of the quality judgement. We compare its performance to two reference metrics on a wide range of content types (speech, music, ambiance, anechoic, reverberated) and focusing on codec artifacts. Results demonstrate that QASTAnet overcomes the aforementioned limitations of the existing methods. The strong correlation between the proposed metric prediction and subjective scores makes it a good candidate for comparing codecs in their development.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmoHeal: An End-to-End System for Personalized Therapeutic Music Retrieval from Fine-grained Emotions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15986v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing digital mental wellness tools often overlook the nuanced emotional states underlying everyday challenges. For example, pre-sleep anxiety affects more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, yet current approaches remain largely static and "one-size-fits-all", failing to adapt to individual needs. In this work, we present EmoHeal, an end-to-end system that delivers personalized, three-stage supportive narratives. EmoHeal detects 27 fine-grained emotions from user text with a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model, mapping them to musical parameters via a knowledge graph grounded in music therapy principles (GEMS, iso-principle). EmoHeal retrieves audiovisual content using the CLAMP3 model to guide users from their current state toward a calmer one ("match-guide-target"). A within-subjects study (N=40) demonstrated significant supportive effects, with participants reporting substantial mood improvement (M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion recognition accuracy (M=4.05, p<0.001). A strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001) validates our fine-grained approach. These findings establish the viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital wellness tools and provides a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music therapy principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Controlling Language Difficulty in Dialogues with Linguistic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14545v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for supporting second language acquisition, particularly in simulating interactive dialogues for speaking practice. However, adapting the language difficulty of LLM-generated responses to match learners' proficiency levels remains a challenge. This work addresses this issue by proposing a framework for controlling language proficiency in educational dialogue systems. Our approach leverages three categories of linguistic features, readability features (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic features (e.g., syntactic tree depth), and lexical features (e.g., simple word ratio), to quantify and regulate text complexity. We demonstrate that training LLMs on linguistically annotated dialogue data enables precise modulation of language proficiency, outperforming prompt-based methods in both flexibility and stability. To evaluate this, we introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric integrating the aforementioned features, which shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty. Empirical results reveal that our approach achieves superior controllability of language proficiency while maintaining high dialogue quality.</p></details> | 15 pages,9 figures |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyse multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed, including a consistent factor number estimator. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyse a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighbouring areas.</p></details> | 45 pages, 3 figures |
| **[The Psychogenic Machine: Simulating AI Psychosis, Delusion Reinforcement and Harm Enablement in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10970v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse psychological symptoms. Whilst the sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can be beneficial, it becomes a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs in vulnerable users. Methods: Psychosis-bench is a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprises 16 structured, 12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions) and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across explicit and implicit conversational contexts. Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37 $\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered. Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions (p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77). Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent property of scale alone. Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Understanding to Generation: An Efficient Shortcut for Evaluating Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03592v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation time.

| **[Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01129v5)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response appropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with contexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics struggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in handling adversarial negative examples. We propose a novel evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) enhanced domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. Our SLMs explicitly incorporate AMR graph information through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning, while both SLM predictions and AMR knowledge are integrated into LLM prompts for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our comprehensive ablation studies reveal that AMR graph information contributes substantially more to performance improvements. Our framework achieves strong correlations with human judgments across multiple datasets, establishing a new benchmark for dialogue evaluation. Our code and data are publicly available.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

This study provides a thorough scientometric analysis of this correlation, synthesizing the intellectual production over 51 years, from 1974 to 2024. Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database was the data source. The data collected were analyzed by two powerful software, viz., CiteSpace and VOSviewer, through which mapping visualizations of the intellectual landscape, trending issues and (re)emerging hotspots were generated. The results indicate that in the 1980s and 1990s, linguistics and AI (AIL) research was not robust, characterized by unstable publication over time. It has, however, witnessed a remarkable increase of publication since then, reaching 1478 articles in 2023, and 546 articles in January-March timespan in 2024, involving emerging issues including Natural language processing, Cross-sectional study, Using bidirectional encoder representation, and Using ChatGPT and hotspots such as Novice programmer, Prioritization, and Artificial intelligence, addressing new horizons, new topics, and launching new applications and powerful deep learning language models including ChatGPT. It concludes that linguistics and AI correlation is established at several levels, research centers, journals, and countries shaping AIL knowledge production and reshaping its future frontiers.</p></details> | 26 pages, 15 figures |

While recent studies have proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10 held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation.

| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Evidence-Based Clinical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10843v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development. We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.</p></details> |  |

While they excel at many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics, remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over 400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics, Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[CancerGUIDE: Cancer Guideline Understanding via Internal Disagreement Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07325v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

We present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion commands using fewer simulated steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. 8 pages</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Laws of Motion Forecasting and Planning -- Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08228v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Continuous Colormap Recovery from a 2D Scalar Field Visualization without a Legend](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20632v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications -- colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color palettes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pruning Spurious Subgraphs for Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05957v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, PrunE retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.

We present a systematic, reproducible benchmark comparing quantum and classical machine learning models for BDE prediction using a chemically curated feature set encompassing atomic properties (atomic numbers, hybridization), bond characteristics (bond order, type), and local environmental descriptors. Our quantum framework, implemented in Qiskit Aer on six qubits, employs ZZFeatureMap encodings with variational ansatz (RealAmplitudes) across multiple architectures Variational Quantum Regressors (VQR), Quantum Support Vector Regressors (QSVR), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), and Quantum Random Forests (QRF). These are rigorously benchmarked against strong classical baselines, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Comprehensive evaluation spanning absolute and relative error metrics, threshold accuracies, and error distributions shows that top-performing quantum models (QCNN, QRF) match the predictive accuracy and robustness of classical ensembles and deep networks, particularly within the chemically prevalent mid-range BDE regime. These findings establish a transparent baseline for quantum-enhanced molecular property prediction and outline a practical foundation for advancing quantum computational chemistry toward near chemical accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To fill this blank, we propose QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry oriented benchmark comprising 350 computational chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields, which contains analytical chemistry, bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry. To systematically evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), they are categorized into three tiers: easy, medium, and difficult. Each problem, rooted in realistic chemical scenarios, is structured to prevent heuristic shortcuts and demand explicit numerical reasoning. QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork for future improvements such as domain-adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal integration. Evaluations on 24 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

In addition, machine learning approaches hold the potential to boost the predictive power of computationally efficient electronic structure methods, such as density functional theory, to chemical accuracy and to correct for fundamental errors in density functional approaches. Here, recent progress in applying machine learning to improve the accuracy of density functional and related approximations is reviewed.

| **[Round-trip Reinforcement Learning: Self-Consistent Training for Better Chemical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01527v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency. For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable foundation models.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[A general optimization framework for mapping local transition-state networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26269v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1 saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Euclidean Fast Attention -- Machine Learning Global Atomic Representations at Linear Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08541v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range correlations are essential across numerous machine learning tasks, especially for data embedded in Euclidean space, where the relative positions and orientations of distant components are often critical for accurate predictions. Self-attention offers a compelling mechanism for capturing these global effects, but its quadratic complexity presents a significant practical limitation. This problem is particularly pronounced in computational chemistry, where the stringent efficiency requirements of machine learning force fields (MLFFs) often preclude accurately modeling long-range interactions. To address this, we introduce Euclidean fast attention (EFA), a linear-scaling attention-like mechanism designed for Euclidean data, which can be easily incorporated into existing model architectures. A core component of EFA are novel Euclidean rotary positional encodings (ERoPE), which enable efficient encoding of spatial information while respecting essential physical symmetries. We empirically demonstrate that EFA effectively captures diverse long-range effects, enabling EFA-equipped MLFFs to describe challenging chemical interactions for which conventional MLFFs yield incorrect results.</p></details> |  |

Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip</p></details> |

Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a set featuring 20 generic reaction templates written in SMARTS, a pattern-based notation designed to describe substructures and reactivity. Additionally, we introduce ProPreT5, a T5-based model specifically adapted for chemistry and, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of directly handling and applying SMARTS reaction templates. To further improve generalization, we propose the first augmentation strategy for SMARTS, which injects structural diversity at the pattern level. Trained on augmented templates, ProPreT5 demonstrates strong predictive performance and generalization to unseen reactions. Together, these contributions provide a novel and practical alternative to current methods, advancing the field of template-based reaction prediction.</p></details> | ICTAI 2025 |

However, taking the Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles(UCCSD) ansatz which is widely used in quantum chemistry as an example, different molecular systems require constructions of distinct quantum operators. Considering the similarity of different molecules, the construction of quantum operators utilizing the similarity can reduce the computational cost significantly. Inspired by the SMILES representation method in computational chemistry, we developed a text-based representation approach for UCCSD quantum operators by leveraging the inherent representational similarities between different molecular systems. This framework explores text pattern similarities in quantum operators and employs text similarity metrics to establish a transfer learning framework. Our approach with a naive baseline setting demonstrates knowledge transfer between different molecular systems for ground-state energy calculations within the GQE paradigm. This discovery offers significant benefits for hybrid quantum-classical computation of molecular ground-state energies, substantially reducing computational resource requirements.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, in computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface. Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection, and dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, their utility is significantly limited by substantial computational costs, which severely restrict accessible timescales for many biologically relevant processes. Despite the encouraging performance of existing machine learning (ML) methods, they struggle to generate extended biomolecular system trajectories, primarily due to the lack of MD datasets and the large computational demands of modeling long historical trajectories. Here, we introduce BioMD, the first all-atom generative model to simulate long-timescale protein-ligand dynamics using a hierarchical framework of forecasting and interpolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of BioMD on the DD-13M (ligand unbinding) and MISATO datasets. For both datasets, BioMD generates highly realistic conformations, showing high physical plausibility and low reconstruction errors. Besides, BioMD successfully generates ligand unbinding paths for 97.1% of the protein-ligand systems within ten attempts, demonstrating its ability to explore critical unbinding pathways. Collectively, these results establish BioMD as a tool for simulating complex biomolecular processes, offering broad applicability for computational chemistry and drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

| **[Amortized Sampling with Transferable Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18175v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14022v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs, and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

All these problems were known to be #P-complete. Building on the intuition that molecular graphs are often sparse and tree-like, we provide fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms using treewidth as our parameter. We also provide extensive experimental results over the entire PubChem database of chemical compounds, containing more than 113 million real-world molecules. In our experiments, we observe that the molecules are indeed sparse and tree-like, with more than 99.9% of them having a treewidth of at most 5. This justifies our choice of parameter. Our experiments also illustrate considerable improvements over the previous approaches. Based on these results, we argue that parameterized algorithms, especially based on treewidth, should be adopted as the default approach for problems in computational chemistry that are defined over molecular graphs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging >87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs.

Existing methods often struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation. Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over diffusion-based methods.</p></details> |  |

In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically constrained approach, suggesting that directly predicting the forces yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, and that energy conservation can be learned during training. This work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Given the difficulty in monitoring and correcting the lack of energy conservation, direct forces should be used with great care. We show that the best approach to exploit the acceleration they afford is to use them in conjunction with conservative forces. A model can be pre-trained efficiently on direct forces, then fine-tuned using backpropagation. At evaluation time, both force types can be used together to avoid unphysical effects while still benefitting almost entirely from the computational efficiency of direct forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (including references) + appendix Conference format, in Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning (2025), Paper id.

Traditional benchmarking, however, often struggles to account for system-specific variability, making it difficult to form actionable conclusions. We present a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that rigorously quantifies performance metrics and their uncertainty, enabling a nuanced comparison of algorithmic strategies. We apply this framework to analyze the Dimer method, comparing Conjugate Gradient (CG) and L-BFGS rotation optimizers, with and without the removal of external rotations, across a benchmark of 500 molecular systems. Our analysis confirms that CG offers higher overall robustness than L-BFGS in this context. While the theoretically-motivated removal of external rotations led to higher computational cost (>40% more energy and force calls) for most systems in this set, our models also reveal a subtle interplay, hinting that this feature may improve the reliability of the L-BFGS optimizer. Rather than identifying a single superior method, our findings support the design of adaptive "chain of methods" workflows. This work showcases how a robust statistical paradigm can move beyond simple performance rankings to inform the intelligent, context-dependent application of computational chemistry methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 30 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running atomistic simulations, monitoring their computational status, analyzing simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in both textual and graphical forms.

This principle forms the basis of transfer learning, where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where, due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction, addressing critical challenges in computational immunology.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.17075</p></details> |

Currently, training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work, we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular conformer generation with flow-based models.</p></details> | ICML 2025 poster |

While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance.

| **[ILVES: Accurate and efficient bond length and angle constraints in molecular dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13075v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-atom, force field-based molecular dynamics simulations are essential tools in computational chemistry, enabling the prediction and analysis of biomolecular systems with atomic-level resolution. However, as system sizes and simulation timescales increase, so does the associated computational cost. To extend simulated time using the same resources, a common strategy is to constrain the fastest degrees of freedom, such as bond lengths, allowing for larger integration time steps without compromising accuracy. The de facto state-of-the-art algorithms for this purpose (SHAKE, LINCS, and P-LINCS) are integrated into most molecular dynamics packages and widely adopted across the field. Despite their impact, these methods exhibit limitations: all converge slowly when high numerical accuracy is required, and the LINCS and P-LINCS algorithms cannot handle general angular constraints, limiting further increases in time step. In this article, we introduce ILVES, a family of parallel algorithms that converge so rapidly that it is now practical to solve bond length and associated angular constraint equations as accurately as the hardware will allow. We have integrated ILVES into Gromacs and our analysis demonstrates that it is superior to the state-of-the-art when constraining bond lengths. Due to its better convergence properties, we also show that if the time step is increased up to 3.5 fs by enforcing angular constraints, ILVES enables a 1.65x increase in simulated time using the same computational resources and wall-clock time, an outcome unattainable with current methods. This advance can significantly reduce the computational cost of most all-atom molecular dynamics simulations while improving their accuracy and extending access to larger systems and longer timescales.</p></details> |  |

However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency.

Following the learning to optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy calculations, and the lowest failure rate.</p></details> |  |

However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.</p></details> |  |

It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |

Some alternatives based on (piecewise deterministic) kinetic velocity jump processes have gained interest over the last decade. One interest of the latter is the possibility to split forces (at the continuous-time level), reducing the numerical cost for sampling the trajectory. Motivated by this, a numerical scheme based on hybrid dynamics combining velocity jumps and Langevin diffusion, numerically more efficient than their classical Langevin counterparts, has been introduced for computational chemistry in [42]. The present work is devoted to the numerical analysis of this scheme. Our main results are, first, the exponential ergodicity of the continuous-time velocity jump Langevin process, second, a Talay-Tubaro expansion of the invariant measure of the numerical scheme on the torus, showing in particular that the scheme is of weak order 2 in the step-size and, third, a bound on the quadratic risk of the corresponding practical MCMC estimator (possibly with Richardson extrapolation). With respect to previous works on the Langevin diffusion, new difficulties arise from the jump operator, which is non-local.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Scalable Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction through Adaptive Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01171v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian matrix prediction is pivotal in computational chemistry, serving as the foundation for determining a wide range of molecular properties. While SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their substantial computational cost--driven by high-order tensor product (TP) operations--restricts their scalability to large molecular systems with extensive basis sets. To address this challenge, we introduce SPHNet, an efficient and scalable equivariant network, that incorporates adaptive SParsity into Hamiltonian prediction. SPHNet employs two innovative sparse gates to selectively constrain non-critical interaction combinations, significantly reducing tensor product computations while maintaining accuracy. To optimize the sparse representation, we develop a Three-phase Sparsity Scheduler, ensuring stable convergence and achieving high performance at sparsity rates of up to 70%. Extensive evaluations on QH9 and PubchemQH datasets demonstrate that SPHNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing up to a 7x speedup over existing models. Beyond Hamiltonian prediction, the proposed sparsification techniques also hold significant potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of other SE(3) equivariant networks, further broadening their applicability and impact.

Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Moreover, we demonstrate improved robustness during MD simulations of the MLIP models trained with the proposed weakly supervised loss. Finally, our approach improves the fine-tuning of foundation models on sparse, highly accurate ab initio data. An implementation of our method and scripts for executing experiments are available at https://github.com/nec-research/PICPS-ML4Sci.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 4 figures, 31 Tables.

A Benchmark for Graph Pattern Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05298v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in graph-related tasks is becoming an increasingly popular and crucial area of research. Recent studies have shown that LLMs exhibit a preliminary ability to understand graph structures and node features. However, the potential of LLMs in graph pattern mining remains largely unexplored. This is a key component in fields such as computational chemistry, biology, and social network analysis. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs' capabilities in graph pattern tasks. We have developed a benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can understand graph patterns based on either terminological or topological descriptions. Additionally, our benchmark tests the LLMs' capacity to autonomously discover graph patterns from data. The benchmark encompasses both synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of models, with a total of 11 tasks and 7 models. Our experimental framework is designed for easy expansion to accommodate new models and datasets. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs have preliminary abilities to understand graph patterns, with O1-mini outperforming in the majority of tasks; (2) Formatting input data to align with the knowledge acquired during pretraining can enhance performance; (3) The strategies employed by LLMs may differ from those used in conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is published in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

In this regard, Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach in computational chemistry and materials science, combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods with computational efficiency orders of magnitude superior to ab-initio methods. This chapter provides an introduction of the fundamentals of learning and how it is applied to construct MLFFs, detailing key methodologies such as neural network potentials and kernel-based models. Emphasis is placed on the construction of SchNet model, as one of the most elemental neural network-based force fields that are nowadays the basis of modern architectures. Additionally, the GDML framework is described in detail as an example of how the elegant formulation of kernel methods can be used to construct mathematically robust and physics-inspired MLFFs. The ongoing advancements in MLFF development continue to expand their applicability, enabling precise simulations of large and complex systems that were previously beyond reach.

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

One of the main ML tasks in drug discovery is to build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an activity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound behaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods exist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's personalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since the chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact leads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by the model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to solve this issue, outputting tailored ML algorithms to the data at hand. Although an important task, AutoML has not been practically used to assist cheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few works related to the field. To address these challenges, this work introduces Auto-ADMET, an interpretable evolutionary-based AutoML method for chemical ADMET property prediction. Auto-ADMET employs a Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) method with a Bayesian Network Model to achieve comparable or better predictive performance against three alternative methods -- standard GGP method, pkCSM and XGBOOST model -- on 12 benchmark chemical ADMET property prediction datasets. The use of a Bayesian Network model on Auto-ADMET's evolutionary process assisted in both shaping the search procedure and interpreting the causes of its AutoML performance.</p></details> |  |

However, full KRR solvers are challenging to scale to large datasets: both direct (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (i.e., PCG) incur prohibitive computational and storage costs. The standard approach to scale KRR to large datasets chooses a set of inducing points and solves an approximate version of the problem, inducing points KRR. However, the resulting solution tends to have worse predictive performance than the full KRR solution. In this work, we introduce a new solver, ASkotch, for full KRR that provides better solutions faster than state-of-the-art solvers for full and inducing points KRR. ASkotch is a scalable, accelerated, iterative method for full KRR that provably obtains linear convergence. Under appropriate conditions, we show that ASkotch obtains condition-number-free linear convergence. This convergence analysis rests on the theory of ridge leverage scores and determinantal point processes. ASkotch outperforms state-of-the-art KRR solvers on a testbed of 23 large-scale KRR regression and classification tasks derived from a wide range of application domains, demonstrating the superiority of full KRR over inducing points KRR. Our work opens up the possibility of as-yet-unimagined applications of full KRR across a number of disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages (including appendices), 16 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Catalyst discovery is fundamental yet challenging in computational chemistry and has garnered significant attention due to the promising performance of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) notably accelerates progress in the discovery of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, where their chemical reactions differ significantly in material phases, temperature, dynamics, etc. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that discusses the progress and latest developments in both areas, particularly with the application of LLM techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a thorough and systematic survey of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, employing a unified and general categorization for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. We examine the progress of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, highlighting their individual advantages and disadvantages, and discuss the challenges faced in this field. Furthermore, we suggest potential directions for future research from the perspective of computer science. Our goal is to assist researchers in computational chemistry, computer science, and related fields in easily tracking the latest advancements, providing a clear overview and roadmap of this area. We also organize and make accessible relevant resources, including article lists and datasets, in an open repository at https://github.com/LuckyGirl-XU/Awesome-Artificial-Intelligence-Empowered-Catalyst-Discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |

Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations.

In this paper we design and discuss an algorithm that has similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which contains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets, which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51 dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to the graph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system. We then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional neural networks can be transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186 dimensional potential surface. We find that our algorithm does provide reasonably accurate results for this larger dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher dimensional potential surface problem.</p></details> |  |

The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p></details> |  |

To further improve performance, researchers have introduced graph neural networks with graph-based molecular representations, such as GEM, incorporating the topology, geometry, 2D or even 3D structures of molecules into pre-training. While most of molecular graphs in existing studies were automatically converted from SMILES sequences, it is to assume that transformer-based language models might be able to implicitly learn structure-aware representations from SMILES sequences. In this paper, we propose \ours{} -- a SMILES-based \underline{\em M}olecular \underline{\em L}anguage \underline{\em M}odel, which randomly masking SMILES subsequences corresponding to specific molecular \underline{\em F}unctional \underline{\em G}roups to incorporate structure information of atoms during the pre-training phase. This technique aims to compel the model to better infer molecular structures and properties, thus enhancing its predictive capabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations across 11 benchmark classification and regression tasks in the chemical domain demonstrate the robustness and superiority of \ours{}. Our findings reveal that \ours{} outperforms existing pre-training models, either based on SMILES or graphs, in 9 out of the 11 downstream tasks, ranking as a close second in the remaining ones.</p></details> | Under review |

Deep learning (DL) approaches have recently emerged as promising alternatives to computationally-heavy classical methods such as density functional theory (DFT). However, we discover that existing DL methods inadequately model inter-atomic forces, particularly for non-bonded atomic pairs, due to their naive usage of bonds and pairwise distances. Consequently, significant prediction errors occur for atoms with low degree (i.e., low coordination numbers) whose conformations are primarily influenced by non-bonded interactions. To address this, we propose REBIND, a novel framework that rewires molecular graphs by adding edges based on the Lennard-Jones potential to capture non-bonded interactions for low-degree atoms. Experimental results demonstrate that REBIND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various molecular sizes, achieving up to a 20\% reduction in prediction error.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9.

Generative AI methods have made significant progress in sampling molecular structures across chemical species, developing force fields, and speeding up simulations. This Perspective offers a structured overview, beginning with the fundamental theoretical concepts in both Generative AI and computational chemistry. It then covers widely used Generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before, and that Generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry. We suggest that to overcome these challenges, future AI models need to integrate core chemical principles, especially from statistical mechanics.</p></details> |  |

This abstraction is useful to modularize and potentially reuse existing components, as well as provide parallelization and ease reproducibility. Existing tools represent the computation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), thus allowing efficient execution by parallelization of concurrent branches. These systems can, however, generally not express cyclic and conditional workflows. We therefore developed Maize, a workflow manager for cyclic and conditional graphs based on the principles of flow-based programming. By running each node of the graph concurrently in separate processes and allowing communication at any time through dedicated inter-node channels, arbitrary graph structures can be executed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool on a dynamic active learning task in computational drug design, involving the use of a small molecule generative model and an associated scoring system, and on a reactivity prediction pipeline using quantum-chemistry and semiempirical approaches.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s Walter Fontana and Leo Buss proposed a novel modeling approach to this question, based on a formal model of computation known as $\lambda$ calculus. The model demonstrated how simple rules, embedded in a combinatorially large space of possibilities, could yield complex, dynamically stable organizations, reminiscent of biochemical reaction networks. Here, we revisit this classic model, called AlChemy, which has been understudied over the past thirty years. We reproduce the original results and study the robustness of those results using the greater computing resources available today. Our analysis reveals several unanticipated features of the system, demonstrating a surprising mix of dynamical robustness and fragility. Specifically, we find that complex, stable organizations emerge more frequently than previously expected, that these organizations are robust against collapse into trivial fixed-points, but that these stable organizations cannot be easily combined into higher order entities. We also study the role played by the random generators used in the model, characterizing the initial distribution of objects produced by two random expression generators, and their consequences on the results. Finally, we provide a constructive proof that shows how an extension of the model, based on typed $\lambda$ calculus, could simulate transitions between arbitrary states in any possible chemical reaction network, thus indicating a concrete connection between AlChemy and chemical reaction networks. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of AlChemy to self-organization in modern programming languages and quantitative approaches to the origin of life.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseAuto: An Auto-Scheduler for Sparse Tensor Computations Using Recursive Loop Nest Restructuring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09549v3)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code generation and performance enhancements for sparse tensor algebra have become essential in many real-world applications, such as quantum computing, physical simulations, computational chemistry, and machine learning. General sparse tensor algebra compilers are not always versatile enough to generate asymptotically optimal code for sparse tensor contractions. This paper shows how to generate asymptotically better schedules for complex sparse tensor expressions using kernel fission and fusion. We present generalized loop restructuring transformations to reduce asymptotic time complexity and memory footprint. Furthermore, we present an auto-scheduler that uses a partially ordered set (poset)-based cost model that uses both time and auxiliary memory complexities to prune the search space of schedules. In addition, we highlight the use of Satisfiability Module Theory (SMT) solvers in sparse auto-schedulers to approximate the Pareto frontier of better schedules to the smallest number of possible schedules, with user-defined constraints available at compile-time. Finally, we show that our auto-scheduler can select better-performing schedules and generate code for them. Our results show that the auto-scheduler provided schedules achieve orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to the code generated by the Tensor Algebra Compiler (TACO) for several computations on different real-world tensors.</p></details> |  |
