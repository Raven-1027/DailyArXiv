When this occurs, they introduce a form of distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively, distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions. We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these acquisition-based or processing-based labels.

| **[Prompt Attacks Reveal Superficial Knowledge Removal in Unlearning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10236v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we demonstrate that certain machine unlearning methods may fail under straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis to assess the extent to which supposedly unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR exhibit robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt attacks (e.g., prepending Hindi filler text to the original prompt recovers 57.3% accuracy). Our logit analysis further indicates that unlearned models are unlikely to hide knowledge through changes in answer formatting, given the strong correlation between output and logit accuracy. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between genuine knowledge removal and superficial output suppression. To facilitate further research, we publicly release our evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve unlearned knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Fleurs-SLU: A Massively Multilingual Benchmark for Spoken Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06117v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoken language understanding (SLU) is indispensable for half of all living languages that lack a formal writing system. Unlike for high-resource languages, for these languages, we cannot offload semantic understanding of speech to the cascade of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-based large language models (LLMs). Even if low-resource languages possess a writing system, ASR for these languages remains unreliable due to limited bimodal speech and text training data. Nonetheless, the evaluation of multilingual SLU is limited to shallow tasks such as intent classification or language identification. This is why we present Fleurs-SLU, a multilingual SLU benchmark that encompasses (i) 692 hours of speech for topical utterance classification in 102 languages and (ii) multiple-choice question answering via listening comprehension spanning 944 hours of speech across 92 languages. We extensively evaluate end-to-end speech classification models, cascaded systems that combine speech-to-text transcription with subsequent LLM-based classification, and multimodal speech-LLMs on Fleurs-SLU. Our results show that cascaded systems are more robust in multilingual SLU, though well-pretrained speech encoders can perform competitively in topical speech classification. Closed-source speech-LLMs match or surpass the performance of cascaded systems. We observe a strong correlation between robust multilingual ASR, effective speech-to-text translation, and strong multilingual SLU, indicating mutual benefits between acoustic and semantic speech representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossWordBench: Evaluating the Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs and LVLMs with Controllable Puzzle Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00043v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reasoning evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) predominantly assess either text-based reasoning or vision-language understanding capabilities, with limited dynamic interplay between textual and visual constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles -- a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in two formats (text and image), supports adjustable difficulty through prefill ratio control, and offers different evaluation strategies, ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs substantially outperform non-reasoning models by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings highlight limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expert Preference-based Evaluation of Automated Related Work Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07955v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards. To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences. Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve based on feedback as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ukplab.github.io/arxiv2025-expert-eval-rw/</p></details> |
| **[Generative AI for Strategic Plan Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07405v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Decorrelated feature importance from local sample weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06337v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature importance (FI) statistics provide a prominent and valuable method of insight into the decision process of machine learning (ML) models, but their effectiveness has well-known limitations when correlation is present among the features in the training data. In this case, the FI often tends to be distributed among all features which are in correlation with the response-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features are in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly correlated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a distinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local sample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML algorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the training data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in causal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting scheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This reduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature is evaluated and compared to others. Moreover, losaw comes with a natural tuning parameter, the minimum effective sample size of the weighted population, which corresponds to an interpretation-prediction-tradeoff, analog to a bias-variance-tradeoff as for classical ML tuning parameters. We demonstrate how losaw can be integrated within decision tree-based ML methods and within mini-batch training of neural networks. We investigate losaw for random forest and convolutional neural networks in a simulation study on settings showing diverse correlation patterns. We found that losaw improves FI consistently. Moreover, it often improves prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution, while maintaining a similar accuracy for in-distribution test data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and FOM_SILD: Metrics for Quantifying P/N Skew Effects in High-Speed Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15105v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Framework for Aligning Image Quality Metrics and Deep Neural Network Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02797v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality plays an important role in the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) that have been widely shown to exhibit sensitivity to changes in imaging conditions. Conventional image quality assessment (IQA) seeks to measure and align quality relative to human perceptual judgments, but we often need a metric that is not only sensitive to imaging conditions but also well-aligned with DNN sensitivities. We first ask whether conventional IQA metrics are also informative of DNN performance. We show theoretically and empirically that conventional IQA metrics are weak predictors of DNN performance for image classification. Using our causal framework, we then develop metrics that exhibit strong correlation with DNN performance, thus enabling us to effectively estimate the quality distribution of large image datasets relative to targeted vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating LLM Reasoning via Early Rejection with Partial Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01969v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$ reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contact Sensors to Remote Cameras: Quantifying Cardiorespiratory Coupling in High-Altitude Exercise Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00773v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) captures the dynamic interaction between the cardiac and respiratory systems--an interaction strengthened by physical exercise and linked to improved physiological function. We examined CRC at high altitude in two states, rest and post-exercise recovery, and found significant differences (p < 0.05). Quantitative analysis revealed that recovery involved more frequent yet less stable episodes of synchronization between respiration and pulse. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of non-contact CRC measurement with remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), observing a strong correlation with oximeter-based metrics (Pearson r = 0.96). These findings highlight the potential of CRC as a sensitive marker for autonomic regulation and its future application in contactless monitoring.

| **[MIHBench: Benchmarking and Mitigating Multi-Image Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00726v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 has accepted this paper</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Uncertainty and Quality of Visual Language Action-enabled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17049v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Language Action (VLA) models are a multi-modal class of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and action planning to enable agents to interpret their environment, comprehend instructions, and perform embodied tasks autonomously. Recently, significant progress has been made to advance this field. These kinds of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908 successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when test oracles are not available. Our findings challenge the adequacy of current evaluation practices that rely solely on binary success rates and pave the way for improved real-time monitoring and adaptive enhancement of VLA-enabled robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation-based inference for Precision Neutrino Physics through Neural Monte Carlo tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23297v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in speech models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, for robot manipulation, it is challenging to accurately model the fine-grained robot-object interaction within the visual space using existing methods which overlooks precise alignment between each action and the corresponding frame. In this paper, we present IRASim, a novel world model capable of generating videos with fine-grained robot-object interaction details, conditioned on historical observations and robot action trajectories. We train a diffusion transformer and introduce a novel frame-level action-conditioning module within each transformer block to explicitly model and strengthen the action-frame alignment. Extensive experiments show that: (1) the quality of the videos generated by our method surpasses all the baseline methods and scales effectively with increased model size and computation; (2) policy evaluations using IRASim exhibit a strong correlation with those using the ground-truth simulator, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world policy evaluation; (3) testing-time scaling through model-based planning with IRASim significantly enhances policy performance, as evidenced by an improvement in the IoU metric on the Push-T benchmark from 0.637 to 0.961; (4) IRASim provides flexible action controllability, allowing virtual robotic arms in datasets to be controlled via a keyboard or VR controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>Opens...</summary><p>Opensource, project website: https://gen-irasim.github.io</p></details> |

This study examined the link between perceptual speech assessments and objective acoustic measures in a large head and neck cancer (HNC) dataset. Trained listeners provided ratings of intelligibility, articulation, voice quality, phonation, speech rate, nasality, and background noise on speech. Strong correlations were found between subjective intelligibility, articulation, and voice quality, likely due to a shared underlying cause of speech symptoms in our speaker population. Objective measures of intelligibility and speech rate aligned with their subjective counterpart. Our results suggest that a single intelligibility measure may be sufficient for the clinical monitoring of speakers treated for HNC using concomitant chemoradiation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

| **[Self-Supervised Continuous Colormap Recovery from a 2D Scalar Field Visualization without a Legend](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20632v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications -- colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color palettes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Maximize margins for robust splicing detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00897v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions, and select the one that maximizes latent margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Fr...</summary><p>in French language.

| **[Communication-Efficient Distributed Training for Collaborative Flat Optima Recovery in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20424v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition, our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove convergence in the non-convex setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main body, 32 pages of supplementary material for detailed derivations and more experiment results</p></details> |
| **[NeuroCLIP: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Method for rTMS-treated Methamphetamine Addiction Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20189v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction. Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone. Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically, we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores. These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches, providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially improving clinical assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Reliability and Validity of a Balance Mat for Measuring Postural Stability: A Combined Robot-Human Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18943v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Postural sway assessment is important for detecting balance problems and identifying people at risk of falls. Force plates (FP) are considered the gold standard postural sway assessment method in laboratory conditions, but their lack of portability and requirement of high-level expertise limit their widespread usage. This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel Balance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical fibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human study. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled sway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human study, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in combination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway mean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range, and sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values greater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were considered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent ICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed moderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman plots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the FP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP. Calibration was used to improve the agreement between the devices. The device demonstrated consistent sway measurement across varied stance conditions, establishing both reliability and validity following appropriate calibration.</p></details> |  |

Several expressway interchanges (ICs) near popular attractions, such as those associated with spring flower viewing, autumn foliage and winter skiing, are examined and visualized. The results reveal strong correlations between search volume trends and the duration of peak tourism seasons. This approach leverages cyberspace behavioral data as a leading indicator of physical movement, providing a proactive tool for traffic management and tourism planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weather-Aware AI Systems versus Route-Optimization AI: A Comprehensive Analysis of AI Applications in Transportation Productivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17099v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent research demonstrates that AI route-optimization systems improve taxi driver productivity by 14\%, this study reveals that such findings capture only a fraction of AI's potential in transportation. We examine comprehensive weather-aware AI systems that integrate deep learning meteorological prediction with machine learning positioning optimization, comparing their performance against traditional operations and route-only AI approaches. Using simulation data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions, we find that weather-aware AI systems increase driver revenue by 107.3\%, compared to 14\% improvements from route-optimization alone. Weather prediction contributes the largest individual productivity gain, with strong correlations between meteorological conditions and demand ($r=0.575$). Economic analysis reveals annual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver, with rapid payback periods and superior return on investment. These findings suggest that current AI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by focusing narrowly on routing algorithms, while weather intelligence represents an untapped \$8.9 billion market opportunity. Our results indicate that future AI implementations should adopt comprehensive approaches that address multiple operational challenges simultaneously rather than optimizing isolated functions.</p></details> | 41 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Project Patti: Why can You Solve Diabolical Puzzles on one Sudoku Website but not Easy Puzzles on another Sudoku Website?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21137v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites, the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 Figures |

While traditional studies have found strong correlations between faculty hiring and attributes such as doctoral department prestige and publication record, they rarely assess whether these associations generalize to individual hiring outcomes, particularly for future candidates outside the original sample. Here, we consider faculty placement as an individual-level prediction task. Our data consist of temporal co-authorship networks with conventional attributes such as doctoral department prestige and bibliometric features. We observe that using the co-authorship network significantly improves predictive accuracy by up to 10% over traditional indicators alone, with the largest gains observed for placements at the most elite (top-10) departments. Our results underscore the role that social networks, professional endorsements, and implicit advocacy play in faculty hiring beyond traditional measures of scholarly productivity and institutional prestige. By introducing a predictive framing of faculty placement and establishing the benefit of considering co-authorship networks, this work provides a new lens for understanding structural biases in academia that could inform targeted interventions aimed at increasing transparency, fairness, and equity in academic hiring practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[VMask: Tunable Label Privacy Protection for Vertical Federated Learning via Layer Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14629v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though vertical federated learning (VFL) is generally considered to be privacy-preserving, recent studies have shown that VFL system is vulnerable to label inference attacks originating from various attack surfaces. Among these attacks, the model completion (MC) attack is currently the most powerful one. Existing defense methods against it either sacrifice model accuracy or incur impractical computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VMask, a novel label privacy protection framework designed to defend against MC attack from the perspective of layer masking. Our key insight is to disrupt the strong correlation between input data and intermediate outputs by applying the secret sharing (SS) technique to mask layer parameters in the attacker's model. We devise a strategy for selecting critical layers to mask, reducing the overhead that would arise from naively applying SS to the entire model. Moreover, VMask is the first framework to offer a tunable privacy budget to defenders, allowing for flexible control over the levels of label privacy according to actual requirements. We built a VFL system, implemented VMask on it, and extensively evaluated it using five model architectures and 13 datasets with different modalities, comparing it to 12 other defense methods. The results demonstrate that VMask achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, successfully thwarting the MC attack (reducing the label inference accuracy to a random guessing level) while preserving model performance (e.g., in Transformer-based model, the averaged drop of VFL model accuracy is only 0.09%). VMask's runtime is up to 60,846 times faster than cryptography-based methods, and it only marginally exceeds that of standard VFL by 1.8 times in a large Transformer-based model, which is generally acceptable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Draft-based Approximate Inference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08373v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, the first method that leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/draft-based-approx-llm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added discussion and comparison with SpecPrefill</p></details> |

However, from a human perspective, such models do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity. Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI), is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a "Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions to mitigate hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 17 figures and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generalist Forecasting with Frozen Video Models via Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13942v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.</p></details> |  |

Existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods can be classified as modality interaction-based methods, modality transformation-based methods and modality similarity-based methods. However, most of these methods highly rely on the strong correlations between modalities, and cannot fully uncover and utilize the correlations between modalities to enhance sentiment analysis. Therefore, these methods usually achieve bad performance for identifying the sentiment of multimodal data with weak correlations. To address this issue, we proposed a two-stage semi-supervised model termed Correlation-aware Multimodal Transformer (CorMulT) which consists pre-training stage and prediction stage. At the pre-training stage, a modality correlation contrastive learning module is designed to efficiently learn modality correlation coefficients between different modalities. At the prediction stage, the learned correlation coefficients are fused with modality representations to make the sentiment prediction. According to the experiments on the popular multimodal dataset CMU-MOSEI, CorMulT obviously surpasses state-of-the-art multimodal sentiment analysis methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Forecastability Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13556v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data. We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative strategies for products with limited forecastability.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often produce presentations with logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS (Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content, Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated tool for assessing presentation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

In the real world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness. Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore, we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Analysing over 13,000 hybrid journals between 2019-2023, the research found substantial growth in open access due to these agreements, although most articles remain paywalled. The results were consistent across all three data sources, showing strong correlations in country-level metrics despite differences in journal coverage and metadata availability. By 2023, transformative agreements enabled the majority of open access in hybrid journals, with particularly high adoption in European countries. The analysis revealed strong alignment between first and corresponding authorship when measuring agreement uptake by publisher and country. This comparative approach supports the use of open metadata for large-scale hybrid open access studies, while using multiple data sources together provides a more robust understanding of hybrid open access adoption than any single database can offer, overcoming individual limitations in coverage and metadata quality.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Incorporating Interventional Independence Improves Robustness against Interventional Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05412v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI. Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative collaborators in linguistic inquiry.</p></details> |  |

In 2024, Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, which enable unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations, entered large-scale beta testing, with Starlink globally leading deployments. This paper presents the first measurement study of commercial DS2D services. Using crowdsourced mobile network data collected in the U.S. between October 2024 and April 2025, our research derives evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and prospective evolution of DS2D technologies providing Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) services to expand existing mobile network connectivity. We observe a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed and the expanding extension of observed measurements, concentrated in accessible but poorly covered areas by terrestrial networks, such as national parks and large low-density counties. The data reveal stable physical-layer value measurement throughout the observation period, with a lower median RSRP (24-dB difference) and a higher RSRQ (3 dB difference) compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on SINR measurements, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 4 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 12 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory decisions regarding satellite licenses, spectrum availability, and allowable radiated power levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

Sustainable irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77) with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and measure program impacts at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and code will be published shortly and links updated in v2</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

However, the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data combinatorially.

Unlike the commonly used Forward Regression (FR) method, which computes regression residuals using an increasing number of selected features, or the Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm (OGA), which selects variables based on their marginal correlations with the residuals, our proposed Gram-Schmidt Forward Regression (GSFR) simplifies the selection process by evaluating marginal correlations between the residuals and the orthogonalized new variables. Moreover, we introduce a new model size selection criterion that determines the number of selected variables by detecting the most significant change in their unique contributions, effectively filtering out redundant predictors along the selection path. While GSFR is theoretically equivalent to FR except for the stopping rule, our refinement and the newly proposed stopping rule significantly improve computational efficiency. In ultra-high dimensional settings, where the dimensionality far exceeds the sample size and predictors exhibit strong correlations, we establish that GSFR achieves a convergence rate comparable to OGA and ensures variable selection consistency under mild conditions. We demonstrate the proposed method {using} simulations and real data examples. Extensive numerical studies show that GSFR outperforms commonly used methods in ultra-high dimensional variable selection.</p></details> |  |

All these problems were known to be #P-complete. Building on the intuition that molecular graphs are often sparse and tree-like, we provide fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms using treewidth as our parameter. We also provide extensive experimental results over the entire PubChem database of chemical compounds, containing more than 113 million real-world molecules. In our experiments, we observe that the molecules are indeed sparse and tree-like, with more than 99.9% of them having a treewidth of at most 5. This justifies our choice of parameter. Our experiments also illustrate considerable improvements over the previous approaches. Based on these results, we argue that parameterized algorithms, especially based on treewidth, should be adopted as the default approach for problems in computational chemistry that are defined over molecular graphs.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging >87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation. Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over diffusion-based methods.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry, bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.

| **[The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11569v5)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, has revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically constrained approach, suggesting that directly predicting the forces yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, and that energy conservation can be learned during training. This work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Given the difficulty in monitoring and correcting the lack of energy conservation, direct forces should be used with great care. We show that the best approach to exploit the acceleration they afford is to use them in conjunction with conservative forces. A model can be pre-trained efficiently on direct forces, then fine-tuned using backpropagation. At evaluation time, both force types can be used together to avoid unphysical effects while still benefitting almost entirely from the computational efficiency of direct forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (including references) + appendix Conference format</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Quantitative Estimates for Performance metrics applied to Saddle Search Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13621v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorous performance evaluation is essential for developing robust algorithms for high-throughput computational chemistry. Traditional benchmarking, however, often struggles to account for system-specific variability, making it difficult to form actionable conclusions. We present a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that rigorously quantifies performance metrics and their uncertainty, enabling a nuanced comparison of algorithmic strategies. We apply this framework to analyze the Dimer method, comparing Conjugate Gradient (CG) and L-BFGS rotation optimizers, with and without the removal of external rotations, across a benchmark of 500 molecular systems. Our analysis confirms that CG offers higher overall robustness than L-BFGS in this context. While the theoretically-motivated removal of external rotations led to higher computational cost (>40% more energy and force calls) for most systems in this set, our models also reveal a subtle interplay, hinting that this feature may improve the reliability of the L-BFGS optimizer. Rather than identifying a single superior method, our findings support the design of adaptive "chain of methods" workflows. This work showcases how a robust statistical paradigm can move beyond simple performance rankings to inform the intelligent, context-dependent application of computational chemistry methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 30 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Aitomia: Your Intelligent Assistant for AI-Driven Atomistic and Quantum Chemical Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08195v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have developed Aitomia - a platform powered by AI to assist in performing AI-driven atomistic and quantum chemical (QC) simulations. This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running atomistic simulations, monitoring their computational status, analyzing simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in both textual and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting large language models that leverage the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem, supporting AI-enhanced computational chemistry tasks ranging from ground-state to excited-state calculations, including geometry optimizations, thermochemistry, and spectral calculations. The multi-agent implementation enables autonomous executions of the complex computational workflows, such as the computation of the reaction enthalpies. Aitomia is the first intelligent assistant publicly accessible online on a cloud computing platform for atomistic simulations of broad scope (Aitomistic Hub at https://aitomistic.xyz). It may also be deployed locally as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, thereby democratizing simulations and accelerating research and development in relevant fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acquiring and Adapting Priors for Novel Tasks via Neural Meta-Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10446v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning, where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where, due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction, addressing critical challenges in computational immunology.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.17075</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Molecular Conformer Generation with SO(3)-Averaged Flow Matching and Reflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09785v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and accurate generation of molecular conformers is desired for downstream computational chemistry and drug discovery tasks. Currently, training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work, we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular conformer generation with flow-based models.</p></details> | ICML 2025 poster |
| **[MolVision: Molecular Property Prediction with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03283v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science. While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance.

| **[ILVES: Accurate and efficient bond length and angle constraints in molecular dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13075v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-atom, force field-based molecular dynamics simulations are essential tools in computational chemistry, enabling the prediction and analysis of biomolecular systems with atomic-level resolution. However, as system sizes and simulation timescales increase, so does the associated computational cost. To extend simulated time using the same resources, a common strategy is to constrain the fastest degrees of freedom, such as bond lengths, allowing for larger integration time steps without compromising accuracy. The de facto state-of-the-art algorithms for this purpose (SHAKE, LINCS, and P-LINCS) are integrated into most molecular dynamics packages and widely adopted across the field. Despite their impact, these methods exhibit limitations: all converge slowly when high numerical accuracy is required, and the LINCS and P-LINCS algorithms cannot handle general angular constraints, limiting further increases in time step. In this article, we introduce ILVES, a family of parallel algorithms that converge so rapidly that it is now practical to solve bond length and associated angular constraint equations as accurately as the hardware will allow. We have integrated ILVES into Gromacs and our analysis demonstrates that it is superior to the state-of-the-art when constraining bond lengths. Due to its better convergence properties, we also show that if the time step is increased up to 3.5 fs by enforcing angular constraints, ILVES enables a 1.65x increase in simulated time using the same computational resources and wall-clock time, an outcome unattainable with current methods. This advance can significantly reduce the computational cost of most all-atom molecular dynamics simulations while improving their accuracy and extending access to larger systems and longer timescales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Chemical Insights: Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency.

| **[MACS: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Optimization of Crystal Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04195v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy calculations, and the lowest failure rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChemGraph: An Agentic Framework for Computational Chemistry Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06363v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science, accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.</p></details> |  |
