| **[Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages. Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data. By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately, distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01129v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response appropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with contexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics struggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in handling adversarial negative examples. We propose a novel evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) enhanced domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. Our SLMs explicitly incorporate AMR graph information through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning, while both SLM predictions and AMR knowledge are integrated into LLM prompts for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our comprehensive ablation studies reveal that AMR graph information contributes substantially more to performance improvements. Our framework achieves strong correlations with human judgments across multiple datasets, establishing a new benchmark for dialogue evaluation. Our code and data are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning Spurious Subgraphs for Graph Out-of-Distribtuion Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05957v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, PrunE retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at: \href{https://github.com/tianyao-aka/PrunE-GraphOOD}{https://github.com/tianyao-aka/PrunE-GraphOOD}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission of ICML2025, with score 4/4/3/3</p></details> |
| **[Decoding Knowledge Attribution in Mixture-of-Experts: A Framework of Basic-Refinement Collaboration and Efficiency Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24593v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mistral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation, late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement" framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination. Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10 experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency, specialization, and robustness.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Direct-to-Cell: A First Look into Starlink's Direct Satellite-to-Device Radio Access Network through Crowdsourced Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00283v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations have recently emerged as a viable access solution for broadband services in underserved areas. In 2024, Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, which enable unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations, entered large-scale beta testing, with Starlink globally leading deployments. This paper presents the first measurement study of commercial DS2D services. Using crowdsourced mobile network data collected in the U.S. between October 2024 and April 2025, our research derives evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and prospective evolution of DS2D technologies providing Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) services to expand existing mobile network connectivity. We observe a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed and the expanding extension of observed measurements, concentrated in accessible but poorly covered areas by terrestrial networks, such as national parks and large low-density counties. The data reveal stable physical-layer value measurement throughout the observation period, with a lower median RSRP (24-dB difference) and a higher RSRQ (3 dB difference) compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on SINR measurements, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 4 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 12 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory decisions regarding satellite licenses, spectrum availability, and allowable radiated power levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Draft-based Approximate Inference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08373v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/draft-based-approx-llm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws of Motion Forecasting and Planning -- A Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08228v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Geometric Embedding for Node Influence Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07435v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional space, where the radial distance from the origin serves as a proxy for various centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and scalable alternative to the standard greedy algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 18 tables; Github repository available (https://github.com/sashakolpakov/graphem/); Package available on PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/graphem-jax/)</p></details> |
| **[earEOG via Periauricular Electrodes to Facilitate Eye Tracking in a Natural Headphone Form Factor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07193v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye tracking technology is frequently utilized to diagnose eye and neurological disorders, assess sleep and fatigue, study human visual perception, and enable novel gaze-based interaction methods. However, traditional eye tracking methodologies are constrained by bespoke hardware that is often cumbersome to wear, complex to apply, and demands substantial computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we investigated Electrooculography (EOG) eye tracking using 14 electrodes positioned around the ears, integrated into a custom-built headphone form factor device. In a controlled experiment, 16 participants tracked stimuli designed to induce smooth pursuits and saccades. Data analysis identified optimal electrode pairs for vertical and horizontal eye movement tracking, benchmarked against gold-standard EOG and camera-based methods. The electrode montage nearest the eyes yielded the best horizontal results. Horizontal smooth pursuits via earEOG showed high correlation with gold-standard measures ($r_{\mathrm{EOG}} = 0.81, p = 0.01$; $r_{\mathrm{CAM}} = 0.56, p = 0.02$), while vertical pursuits were weakly correlated ($r_{\mathrm{EOG}} = 0.28, p = 0.04$; $r_{\mathrm{CAM}} = 0.35, p = 0.05$). Voltage deflections when performing saccades showed strong correlation in the horizontal direction ($r_{\mathrm{left}} = 0.99, p = 0.0$; $r_{\mathrm{right}} = 0.99, p = 0.0$) but low correlation in the vertical direction ($r_{\mathrm{up}} = 0.6, p = 0.23$; $r_{\mathrm{down}} = 0.19, p = 0.73$). Overall, horizontal earEOG demonstrated strong performance, indicating its potential effectiveness, while vertical earEOG results were poor, suggesting limited feasibility in our current setup.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Bayesian variable selection in a Cox proportional hazards model with the "Sum of Single Effects" prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06233v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by genetic fine-mapping applications, we introduce a new approach to Bayesian variable selection regression (BVSR) for time-to-event (TTE) outcomes. This new approach is designed to deal with the specific challenges that arise in genetic fine-mapping, including: the presence of very strong correlations among the covariates, often exceeding 0.99; very large data sets containing potentially thousands of covariates and hundreds of thousands of samples. We accomplish this by extending the "Sum of Single Effects" (SuSiE) method to the Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model. We demonstrate the benefits of the new method, "CoxPH-SuSiE", over existing BVSR methods for TTE outcomes in simulated fine-mapping data sets. We also illustrate CoxPH-SuSiE on real data by fine-mapping asthma loci using data from UK Biobank. This fine-mapping identified 14 asthma risk SNPs in 8 asthma risk loci, among which 6 had strong evidence for being causal (posterior inclusion probability greater than 50%). Two of the 6 putatively causal variants are known to be pathogenic, and others lie within a genomic sequence that is known to regulate the expression of GATA3.</p></details> |  |
| **[FPSAttention: Training-Aware FP8 and Sparsity Co-Design for Fast Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04648v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to the lack of joint optimization. We introduce FPSAttention, a novel training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fps.ziplab.co</p></details> |
| **[Estimating Total Lung Volume from Pixel-level Thickness Maps of Chest Radiographs Using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12509v6)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To estimate the total lung volume (TLV) from real and synthetic frontal chest radiographs (CXR) on a pixel level using lung thickness maps generated by a U-Net deep learning model. Methods: This retrospective study included 5,959 chest CT scans from two public datasets: the lung nodule analysis 2016 (n=656) and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) pulmonary embolism detection challenge 2020 (n=5,303). Additionally, 72 participants were selected from the Klinikum Rechts der Isar dataset (October 2018 to December 2019), each with a corresponding chest radiograph taken within seven days. Synthetic radiographs and lung thickness maps were generated using forward projection of CT scans and their lung segmentations. A U-Net model was trained on synthetic radiographs to predict lung thickness maps and estimate TLV. Model performance was assessed using mean squared error (MSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), and two-sided Student's t-distribution. Results: The study included 72 participants (45 male, 27 female, 33 healthy: mean age 62 years [range 34-80]; 39 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: mean age 69 years [range 47-91]). TLV predictions showed low error rates ($MSE_{Public-Synthetic}$=0.16 $L^2$, $MSE_{KRI-Synthetic}$=0.20 $L^2$, $MSE_{KRI-Real}$=0.35 $L^2$) and strong correlations with CT-derived reference standard TLV ($n_{Public-Synthetic}$=1,191, r=0.99, P<0.001; $n_{KRI-Synthetic}$=72, r=0.97, P<0.001; $n_{KRI-Real}$=72, r=0.91, P<0.001). The Luna16 test data demonstrated the highest performance, with the lowest mean squared error (MSE = 0.09 $L^2$) and strongest correlation (r = 0.99, P <0.001) for TLV estimation. Conclusion: The U-Net-generated pixel-level lung thickness maps successfully estimated TLV for both synthetic and real radiographs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{COVER} (\textbf{\underline{CO}}unterfactual \textbf{\underline{V}}id\textbf{\underline{E}}o \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding. COVER establishes a new standard for assessing MLLMs' logical reasoning abilities in dynamic environments.

| **[From Understanding to Generation: An Efficient Shortcut for Evaluating Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03592v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation time. We plan to publish our benchmark adaptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Equivariance Error-Based Metrics for Evaluating Sampling-Frequency-Independent Property of Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03550v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio signal processing methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained only at a single sampling frequency (SF) and therefore require signal resampling to handle untrained SFs. However, recent studies have shown that signal resampling can degrade performance with untrained SFs. This problem has been overlooked because most studies evaluate only the performance at trained SFs. In this paper, to assess the robustness of DNNs to SF changes, which we refer to as the SF-independent (SFI) property, we propose three metrics to quantify the SFI property on the basis of local equivariance error (LEE). LEE measures the robustness of DNNs to input transformations. By using signal resampling as input transformation, we extend LEE to measure the robustness of audio source separation methods to signal resampling. The proposed metrics are constructed to quantify the SFI property in specific network components responsible for predicting time-frequency masks. Experiments on music source separation demonstrated a strong correlation between the proposed metrics and performance degradation at untrained SFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, accepted for European Signal Processing Conference 2025 (EUSIPCO 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional Pipeline for Fine-grained Crowdsourcing Earthquake Damage Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03360v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid, fine-grained disaster damage assessment is essential for effective emergency response, yet remains challenging due to limited ground sensors and delays in official reporting. Social media provides a rich, real-time source of human-centric observations, but its multimodal and unstructured nature presents challenges for traditional analytical methods. In this study, we propose a structured Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional (3M) pipeline that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to assess disaster impacts. We evaluate three foundation models across two major earthquake events using both macro- and micro-level analyses. Results show that MLLMs effectively integrate image-text signals and demonstrate a strong correlation with ground-truth seismic data. However, performance varies with language, epicentral distance, and input modality. This work highlights the potential of MLLMs for disaster assessment and provides a foundation for future research in applying MLLMs to real-time crisis contexts. The code and data are released at: https://github.com/missa7481/EMNLP25_earthquake</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-efficient Learning of Concepts with Theoretical Guarantees: from Data to Concepts without Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06536v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is a vital part of many real-world systems, but several concerns remain about the lack of interpretability, explainability and robustness of black-box AI systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) address some of these challenges by learning interpretable concepts from high-dimensional data, e.g. images, which are used to predict labels. An important issue in CBMs are spurious correlation between concepts, which effectively lead to learning "wrong" concepts. Current mitigating strategies have strong assumptions, e.g., they assume that the concepts are statistically independent of each other, or require substantial interaction in terms of both interventions and labels provided by annotators. In this paper, we describe a framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the learned concepts and on the number of required labels, without requiring any interventions. Our framework leverages causal representation learning (CRL) methods to learn latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations in a unsupervised way, and then learns to align these variables with interpretable concepts with few concept labels. We propose a linear and a non-parametric estimator for this mapping, providing a finite-sample high probability result in the linear case and an asymptotic consistency result for the non-parametric estimator. We evaluate our framework in synthetic and image benchmarks, showing that the learned concepts have less impurities and are often more accurate than other CBMs, even in settings with strong correlations between concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 20 figures, 12 Tables, Preprint</p></details> |

We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025.

Current evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context, encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation with human judgments. Experiments across diverse systems demonstrate CiteEval-Auto's superior ability to capture the multifaceted nature of citations compared to existing metrics, offering a principled and scalable approach to evaluate and improve model-generated citations.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

There is wide variation in cardiac shape and motion patterns, influenced by demographic, anthropometric and disease factors. Unravelling normal patterns of shape and motion, and understanding how each individual deviates from the norm, would facilitate accurate diagnosis and personalised treatment strategies. To this end, we developed a conditional generative model, MeshHeart, to learn the distribution of shape and motion patterns for the left and right ventricles of the heart. To model the high-dimensional spatio-temporal mesh data, MeshHeart employs a geometric encoder to represent cardiac meshes in a latent space, and a temporal Transformer to model the motion dynamics of latent representations. Based on MeshHeart, we investigate the latent space of 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences and propose a distance metric, latent delta, which quantifies the deviation of a real heart from its personalised normative pattern. In experiments using a large cardiac magnetic resonance image dataset of 38,309 subjects from the UK Biobank, MeshHeart demonstrates high performance in cardiac mesh sequence reconstruction and generation. Latent space features are discriminative for cardiac disease classification, whereas latent delta exhibits strong correlations with clinical phenotypes in phenome-wide association studies. The code and the trained model are released to support further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Typical embeddings range in size from hundreds to thousands of dimensions, making the size of the embeddings, and the speed of comparison, a significant issue. Quantisation is a class of mechanism which replaces the floating point values with a smaller representation, for example a short integer. This gives an approximation of the embedding space in return for a smaller data representation and a faster comparison function. Here we take this idea almost to its extreme: we show how vectors of arbitrary-precision floating point values can be replaced by vectors whose elements are drawn from the set {-1,0,1}. This yields very significant savings in space and metric evaluation cost, while maintaining a strong correlation for similarity measurements. This is achieved by way of a class of convex polytopes which exist in the high-dimensional space. In this article we give an outline description of these objects, and show how they can be used for the basis of such radical quantisation while maintaining a surprising degree of accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SISAP25 International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications</p></details> |
| **[A Bayesian Inference Approach for Reducing Inter-Investigator Variability in Sampling-Based Land Cover Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15720v3)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Land cover classification faces persistent challenges with inter-investigator variability and salt-and-pepper noise. Although cloud platforms such as Google Earth Engine have made land cover classification more accessible, these issues persist, particularly when multiple investigators contribute to the process. This study developed a robust classification approach that integrates unsupervised clustering of investigator maps with a Bayesian inference framework using Dirichlet distributions. In this study, 44 investigators collected stratified reference samples across four land cover classes using point-based visual interpretation in Saitama City, Japan. We trained three different classifiers, Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Single hidden layer Feed-forward Neural Networks (SFNN), and enhanced the system by implementing unsupervised clustering (k-Means or k-Medoids) to group reliable maps based on entropy characteristics. The Bayesian framework, employing Dirichlet distributions for both likelihood and prior distributions, enables sequential probability updates while preserving probabilistic class assignments. The Bayesian inference from the SVM classification maps achieved the highest mean overall accuracy of 0.857 for Monte Carlo sampling from the referenced JAXA land use land cover map, improving upon the non-Bayesian SVM map (0.855, p < 0.001). Analysis revealed a strong correlation (r=0.710) between investigators' labeling quality and classification accuracy, suggesting that selecting high-quality investigator maps improves the robustness of fusion. The Interspersion and Juxtaposition Index (IJI) showed that fused maps from SVM-based maps selected by k-Means reduced salt-and-pepper noise (IJI: 56.652) compared to baseline maps (IJI: 69.867). Our approach demonstrates an effective approach for combining multiple land cover classifications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Beyond Factual Accuracy: Evaluating Coverage of Diverse Factual Information in Long-form Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03545v4)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents ICAT, an evaluation framework for measuring coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the qualitative aspects of long-form responses produced by LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing automatic CRS evaluation methods are proven insufficient for evaluating the dynamic nature of recommendation conversations. This work proposes FACE: a Fine-grained, Aspect-based Conversation Evaluation method that provides evaluation scores for diverse turn and dialogue level qualities of recommendation conversations. FACE is reference-free and shows strong correlation with human judgments, achieving system correlation of 0.9 and turn/dialogue-level of 0.5, outperforming state-of-the-art CRS evaluation methods by a large margin. Additionally, unlike existing LLM-based methods that provide single uninterpretable scores, FACE provides insights into the system performance and enables identifying and locating problems within conversations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Context Sensitivity and the Knob Behind It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07404v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When making predictions, a language model must trade off how much it relies on its context vs. its prior knowledge. Choosing how sensitive the model is to its context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this paper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining whether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To guide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In this task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a question (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior or contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer for both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task, instruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it with high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow down which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear time algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single layer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge. Interestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find that the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model but also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally, we show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly it separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace. These results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses between context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism that controls this behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Our previous work undertook the first substantial spatial modelling investigation of temperature record-breaking across years for any given day within the year, employing a dataset consisting of over sixty years of daily maximum temperatures across peninsular Spain. That dataset also supplies daily minimum temperatures (which, in fact, are now available through 2023). Here, the dataset is converted into a daily pair of binary events, indicators, for that day, of whether a yearly record was broken for the daily maximum temperature and/or for the daily minimum temperature. Joint modelling addresses several inference issues: (i) defining/modelling record-breaking with bivariate time series of yearly indicators, (ii) strength of relationship between record-breaking events, (iii) prediction of joint, conditional and marginal record-breaking, (iv) persistence in record-breaking across days, (v) spatial interpolation across peninsular Spain. We substantially expand our previous work to enable investigation of these issues. We observe strong correlation between both processes but a growing trend of climate change that is well differentiated between them both spatially and temporally as well as different strengths of persistence and spatial dependence.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (+25 pages supplement), 13 figures (+14 figures supplement), 3 tables (+4 tables supplement)</p></details> |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proxy-FDA: Proxy-based Feature Distribution Alignment for Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models without Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24088v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models pre-trained on massive data encode rich representations of real-world concepts, which can be adapted to downstream tasks by fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often leads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of robust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without affecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching the original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such point-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the feature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose a novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the structural knowledge in feature space. Proxy-FDA performs Feature Distribution Alignment (using nearest neighbor graphs) between the pre-trained and fine-tuned feature spaces, and the alignment is further improved by informative proxies that are generated dynamically to increase data diversity. Experiments show that Proxy-FDA significantly reduces concept forgetting during fine-tuning, and we find a strong correlation between forgetting and a distributional distance metric (in comparison to L2 distance). We further demonstrate Proxy-FDA's benefits in various fine-tuning settings (end-to-end, few-shot and continual tuning) and across different tasks like image classification, captioning and VQA.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Diffusion Sampling Path Tells More: An Efficient Plug-and-Play Strategy for Sample Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23343v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models often exhibit inconsistent sample quality due to stochastic variations inherent in their sampling trajectories. Although training-based fine-tuning (e.g. DDPO [1]) and inference-time alignment techniques[2] aim to improve sample fidelity, they typically necessitate full denoising processes and external reward signals. This incurs substantial computational costs, hindering their broader applicability. In this work, we unveil an intriguing phenomenon: a previously unobserved yet exploitable link between sample quality and characteristics of the denoising trajectory during classifier-free guidance (CFG). Specifically, we identify a strong correlation between high-density regions of the sample distribution and the Accumulated Score Differences (ASD)--the cumulative divergence between conditional and unconditional scores. Leveraging this insight, we introduce CFG-Rejection, an efficient, plug-and-play strategy that filters low-quality samples at an early stage of the denoising process, crucially without requiring external reward signals or model retraining. Importantly, our approach necessitates no modifications to model architectures or sampling schedules and maintains full compatibility with existing diffusion frameworks. We validate the effectiveness of CFG-Rejection in image generation through extensive experiments, demonstrating marked improvements on human preference scores (HPSv2, PickScore) and challenging benchmarks (GenEval, DPG-Bench). We anticipate that CFG-Rejection will offer significant advantages for diverse generative modalities beyond images, paving the way for more efficient and reliable high-quality sample generation.</p></details> |  |

This is the first approach capable of generating realistic volumetric internal anatomy images solely based on external body shape and demographics, without any internal imaging. Surf2CT proceeds through three sequential stages: (1) Surface Completion, reconstructing a complete signed distance function (SDF) from partial torso scans using conditional 3D flow matching; (2) Coarse CT Synthesis, generating a low-resolution CT volume from the completed SDF and demographic information; and (3) CT Super-Resolution, refining the coarse volume into a high-resolution CT via a patch-wise conditional flow model. Each stage utilizes a 3D-adapted EDM2 backbone trained via flow matching. We trained our model on a combined dataset of 3,198 torso CT scans (approximately 1.13 million axial slices) sourced from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the AutoPET challenge. Evaluation on 700 paired torso surface-CT cases demonstrated strong anatomical fidelity: organ volumes exhibited small mean percentage differences (range from -11.1% to 4.4%), and muscle/fat body composition metrics matched ground truth with strong correlation (range from 0.67 to 0.96). Lung localization had minimal bias (mean difference -2.5 mm), and surface completion significantly improved metrics (Chamfer distance: from 521.8 mm to 2.7 mm; Intersection-over-Union: from 0.87 to 0.98). Surf2CT establishes a new paradigm for non-invasive internal anatomical imaging using only external data, opening opportunities for home-based healthcare, preventive medicine, and personalized clinical assessments without the risks associated with conventional imaging techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2025 submitted</p></details> |
| **[Minimal Sufficient Views: A DNN model making predictions with more evidence has higher accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01095v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit high performance in image recognition; however, the reasons for their strong generalization abilities remain unclear. A plausible hypothesis is that DNNs achieve robust and accurate predictions by identifying multiple pieces of evidence from images. Thus, to test this hypothesis, this study proposed minimal sufficient views (MSVs). MSVs is defined as a set of minimal regions within an input image that are sufficient to preserve the prediction of DNNs, thus representing the evidence discovered by the DNN. We empirically demonstrated a strong correlation between the number of MSVs (i.e., the number of pieces of evidence) and the generalization performance of the DNN models. Remarkably, this correlation was found to hold within a single DNN as well as between different DNNs, including convolutional and transformer models. This suggested that a DNN model that makes its prediction based on more evidence has a higher generalization performance. We proposed a metric based on MSVs for DNN model selection that did not require label information. Consequently, we empirically showed that the proposed metric was less dependent on the degree of overfitting, rendering it a more reliable indicator of model performance than existing metrics, such as average confidence.</p></details> | 24 pages |

The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals, which we hope will serve as an important finding for future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Findings; camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Synthetic Context Extension via Retrieval Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22316v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context, retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data have high overlap with retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, they are still evaluated by disjoint toolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning, and customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional semantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing 4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles. MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference. Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), a deep learning framework that synthesizes black hole images directly from physical parameters. The model incorporates a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to enhance accuracy and stability. We have constructed a dataset of 2,157 GRRT-simulated images for training the BCDDM, which spans seven key physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. BCDDM offers a novel approach to reducing the computational costs of black hole image generation, providing a faster and more efficient pathway for dataset augmentation, parameter estimation, and model fitting.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10figures |

Detecting and Evaluating Instruction-Guided Image Edits with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20405v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing models offer increased personalization opportunities in generative tasks. However, properly evaluating their results is challenging, and most of the existing metrics lag in terms of alignment with human judgment and explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce DICE (DIfference Coherence Estimator), a model designed to detect localized differences between the original and the edited image and to assess their relevance to the given modification request. DICE consists of two key components: a difference detector and a coherence estimator, both built on an autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trained using a strategy that leverages self-supervision, distillation from inpainting networks, and full supervision. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate each stage of our pipeline, comparing different MLLMs within the proposed framework. We demonstrate that DICE effectively identifies coherent edits, effectively evaluating images generated by different editing models with a strong correlation with human judgment. We publicly release our source code, models, and data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prismatic Synthesis: Gradient-based Data Diversification Boosts Generalization in LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20161v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective generalization in language models depends critically on the diversity of their training data. Yet existing diversity metrics often fall short of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from model behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training data actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we measure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over 300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM reasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies diversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small off-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms alternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\rho \approx 0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present Prismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale synthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen, out-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours. For example, PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM, outperforms R1-Distill-Qwen-7B -- the same base model trained on proprietary data generated by 671B R1 -- on 6 out of 7 challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries, and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG). PatentMind decomposes patents into three core dimensions: technical feature, application domain, and claim scope, to compute dimension-specific similarity scores. These scores are dynamically weighted through a four-stage reasoning process which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment. To support evaluation, we construct PatentSimBench, a human-annotated benchmark comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that PatentMind achieves a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations, significantly outperforming embedding-based models and advanced prompt engineering methods.These results highlight the effectiveness of modular reasoning frameworks in overcoming key limitations of embedding-based methods for analyzing patent similarity.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity, technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic, and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and generalizability of our framework.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating these policies in real-world scenarios remains time-consuming and challenging, particularly as the number of tasks scales and environmental conditions change. In this work, we demonstrate that world models can serve as a scalable, reproducible, and reliable proxy for real-world robot policy evaluation. A key challenge is generating accurate policy videos from world models that faithfully reflect the robot actions. We observe that directly inputting robot actions or using high-dimensional encoding methods often fails to generate action-following videos. To address this, we propose Policy2Vec, a simple yet effective approach to turn a video generation model into a world simulator that follows latent action to generate the robot video. We then introduce WorldEval, an automated pipeline designed to evaluate real-world robot policies entirely online. WorldEval effectively ranks various robot policies and individual checkpoints within a single policy, and functions as a safety detector to prevent dangerous actions by newly developed robot models. Through comprehensive paired evaluations of manipulation policies in real-world environments, we demonstrate a strong correlation between policy performance in WorldEval and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our method significantly outperforms popular methods such as real-to-sim approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at https://worldeval.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the explicit alignment between generated images and prompts, neglecting the alignment with real-world knowledge beyond prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Align Beyond Prompts (ABP), a comprehensive benchmark designed to measure the alignment of generated images with real-world knowledge that extends beyond the explicit user prompts. ABP comprises over 2,000 meticulously crafted prompts, covering real-world knowledge across six distinct scenarios. We further introduce ABPScore, a metric that utilizes existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to assess the alignment between generated images and world knowledge beyond prompts, which demonstrates strong correlations with human judgments. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular T2I models using ABP, we find that even state-of-the-art models, such as GPT-4o, face limitations in integrating simple real-world knowledge into generated images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a training-free strategy within ABP, named Inference-Time Knowledge Injection (ITKI). By applying this strategy to optimize 200 challenging samples, we achieved an improvement of approximately 43% in ABPScore.

However, the factors governing a dataset's suitability for effective probe training are not well-understood. This study hypothesizes that probe performance on such datasets reflects characteristics of both the LLM's generated responses and its internal feature space. Through quantitative analysis of probe performance and LLM response uncertainty across a series of tasks, we find a strong correlation: improved probe performance consistently corresponds to a reduction in response uncertainty, and vice versa. Subsequently, we delve deeper into this correlation through the lens of feature importance analysis. Our findings indicate that high LLM response variance is associated with a larger set of important features, which poses a greater challenge for probe models and often results in diminished performance. Moreover, leveraging the insights from response uncertainty analysis, we are able to identify concrete examples where LLM representations align with human knowledge across diverse domains, offering additional evidence of interpretable reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> | 18 Pages |

While effective and interpretable, these methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale evaluation and training scenarios. To address this, we propose VeriFastScore, which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on evidence from Google Search. We show that this task cannot be solved via few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives ~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims, judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence. However, our fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level (r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence retrieval) over VeriScore. To facilitate future factuality research, we publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate how knowledge popularity affects LLMs' ability to perceive their knowledge boundaries. Focusing on entity-centric factual question answering (QA), we quantify knowledge popularity from three perspectives: the popularity of entities in the question, the popularity of entities in the answer, and relation popularity, defined as their co-occurrence frequency. Experiments on three representative datasets containing knowledge with varying popularity show that LLMs exhibit better QA performance, higher confidence, and more accurate perception on more popular knowledge, with relation popularity having the strongest correlation. Cause knowledge popularity shows strong correlation with LLMs' QA performance, we propose to leverage these signals for confidence calibration. This improves the accuracy of answer correctness prediction by an average of 5.24% across all models and datasets. Furthermore, we explore prompting LLMs to estimate popularity without external corpora, which yields a viable alternative.</p></details> |  |

However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality. Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency. While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models. Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity. Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

Tackling Intersectional Biases in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17280v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The biases exhibited by text-to-image (TTI) models are often treated as independent, though in reality, they may be deeply interrelated. Addressing bias along one dimension - such as ethnicity or age - can inadvertently affect another, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities. Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce BiasConnect, a novel tool for analyzing and quantifying bias interactions in TTI models. BiasConnect uses counterfactual interventions along different bias axes to reveal the underlying structure of these interactions and estimates the effect of mitigating one bias axis on another. These estimates show strong correlation (+0.65) with observed post-mitigation outcomes. Building on BiasConnect, we propose InterMit, an intersectional bias mitigation algorithm guided by user-defined target distributions and priority weights. InterMit achieves lower bias (0.33 vs. 0.52) with fewer mitigation steps (2.38 vs. 3.15 average steps), and yields superior image quality compared to traditional techniques. Although our implementation is training-free, InterMit is modular and can be integrated with many existing debiasing approaches for TTI models, making it a flexible and extensible solution.</p></details> |  |

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Generative Model with Causality Constraint for Mitigating Biases in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16708v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting counterfactual user feedback is essential for building effective recommender systems. However, latent confounding bias can obscure the true causal relationship between user feedback and item exposure, ultimately degrading recommendation performance. Existing causal debiasing approaches often rely on strong assumptions-such as the availability of instrumental variables (IVs) or strong correlations between latent confounders and proxy variables-that are rarely satisfied in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative framework called Latent Causality Constraints for Debiasing representation learning in Recommender Systems (LCDR). Specifically, LCDR leverages an identifiable Variational Autoencoder (iVAE) as a causal constraint to align the latent representations learned by a standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) through a unified loss function. This alignment allows the model to leverage even weak or noisy proxy variables to recover latent confounders effectively. The resulting representations are then used to improve recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LCDR consistently outperforms existing methods in both mitigating bias and improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[KoBALT: Korean Benchmark For Advanced Linguistic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16125v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.</p></details> | Under Reveiw |
| **[SLMEval: Entropy-Based Calibration for Human-Aligned Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16003v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks. In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition, SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated evaluators such as G-eval.</p></details> |  |

Building on earlier studies of LLMs for tabular tasks, we probe how in-context learning (ICL), model scale, instruction tuning, and domain bias affect Tabular QA (TQA) robustness by testing LLMs, under diverse augmentations and perturbations, on diverse domains: Wikipedia-based $\textbf{WTQ}$, financial $\textbf{TAT-QA}$, and scientific $\textbf{SCITAB}$. Although instruction tuning and larger, newer LLMs deliver stronger, more robust TQA performance, data contamination and reliability issues, especially on $\textbf{WTQ}$, remain unresolved. Through an in-depth attention analysis, we reveal a strong correlation between perturbation-induced shifts in attention dispersion and the drops in performance, with sensitivity peaking in the model's middle layers. We highlight the need for improved interpretable methodologies to develop more reliable LLMs for table comprehension.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Epistemic Mixture of Experts (EMoE), a novel framework for efficiently estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion models. EMoE leverages pre-trained networks without requiring additional training, enabling direct uncertainty estimation from a prompt. We leverage a latent space within the diffusion process that captures epistemic uncertainty better than existing methods. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate EMoE's effectiveness, showing a strong correlation between uncertainty and image quality. Additionally, EMoE identifies under-sampled languages and regions with higher uncertainty, revealing hidden biases in the training set. This capability demonstrates the relevance of EMoE as a tool for addressing fairness and accountability in AI-generated content.</p></details> |  |

While recent studies have proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10 held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation.</p></details> | 13 pages |

DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>See w...</summary><p>See website for videos: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/gear/dreamgen</p></details> |
| **[Computational Reasoning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20771v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development and widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), multidimensional evaluation has become increasingly critical. However, current evaluations are often domain-specific and overly complex, limiting their effectiveness as cross-domain proxies for core capabilities. To address these limitations and enable a unified and simple evaluation framework, an ideal proxy task should target a basic capability that generalizes across tasks and is independent of domain-specific knowledge. Turing machine provides a powerful theoretical lens by reducing complex processes to basic, domain-agnostic computational operations. This perspective offers a principled framework for evaluating basic computational abilities essential to a wide range of tasks. Motivated by this abstraction, we introduce \textbf{Turing Machine Bench}, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to \textbf{strictly follow rules} and \textbf{accurately manage internal states} for multi-step, referred to as \textbf{computational reasoning}. TMBench incorporates four key features: self-contained and knowledge-agnostic reasoning, a minimalistic multi-step structure, controllable difficulty, and a solid theoretical foundation based on Turing machine. Empirical results demonstrate that TMBench serves as an effective proxy for evaluating computational reasoning on representative LLMs. It produces clear step-wise accuracy curves, revealing LLMs' ability to execute multi-step reasoning processes. By analyzing performance trends across TMBench and established reasoning benchmarks, we find strong correlations with real-world tasks, bridging real-task evaluation with basic ability assessment. These findings suggest that TMBench holds potential as a cross-domain dimension for evaluating reasoning in LLMs. Code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/HaitaoWuTJU/Turing-Machine-Bench}{Repo}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Hybrid Language Model via Uncertainty-Aware Opportunistic and Compressed Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11788v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support emerging language-based applications using dispersed and heterogeneous computing resources, the hybrid language model (HLM) offers a promising architecture, where an on-device small language model (SLM) generates draft tokens that are validated and corrected by a remote large language model (LLM). However, the original HLM suffers from substantial communication overhead, as the LLM requires the SLM to upload the full vocabulary distribution for each token. Moreover, both communication and computation resources are wasted when the LLM validates tokens that are highly likely to be accepted. To overcome these limitations, we propose communication-efficient and uncertainty-aware HLM (CU-HLM). In CU-HLM, the SLM transmits truncated vocabulary distributions only when its output uncertainty is high. We validate the feasibility of this opportunistic transmission by discovering a strong correlation between SLM's uncertainty and LLM's rejection probability. Furthermore, we theoretically derive optimal uncertainty thresholds and optimal vocabulary truncation strategies. Simulation results show that, compared to standard HLM, CU-HLM achieves up to 206$\times$ higher token throughput by skipping 74.8% transmissions with 97.4% vocabulary compression, while maintaining 97.4% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables; This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This is mainly due to the strong performance of INRs in many computer vision tasks. These networks can extract a continuous signal representation given a discrete signal representation. In previous studies, it has been repeatedly shown that INR performance has a strong correlation with the activation functions used in its multilayer perceptrons. Although numerous activation functions have been proposed that are competitive with one another, they share some common set of challenges such as spectral bias(Lack of sensitivity to high-frequency content in signals), limited robustness to signal noise and difficulties in simultaneous capturing both local and global features. and furthermore, the requirement for manual parameter tuning. To address these issues, we introduce a novel activation function, Band Shifted Raised Cosine Activated Implicit Neural Networks \textbf{(BandRC)} tailored to enhance signal representation capacity further. We also incorporate deep prior knowledge extracted from the signal to adjust the activation functions through a task-specific model. Through a mathematical analysis and a series of experiments which include image reconstruction (with a +8.93 dB PSNR improvement over the nearest counterpart), denoising (with a +0.46 dB increase in PSNR), super-resolution (with a +1.03 dB improvement over the nearest State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) method for 6X super-resolution), inpainting, and 3D shape reconstruction we demonstrate the dominance of BandRC over existing state of the art activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted as a conference paper to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While recent multimodal models have started to support pointing capabilities, existing benchmarks typically focus only on referential object localization tasks. We introduce PointArena, a comprehensive platform for evaluating multimodal pointing across diverse reasoning scenarios. PointArena comprises three components: (1) Point-Bench, a curated dataset containing approximately 1,000 pointing tasks across five reasoning categories; (2) Point-Battle, an interactive, web-based arena facilitating blind, pairwise model comparisons, which has already gathered over 4,500 anonymized votes; and (3) Point-Act, a real-world robotic manipulation system allowing users to directly evaluate multimodal model pointing capabilities in practical settings. We conducted extensive evaluations of both state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary multimodal models. Results indicate that Molmo-72B consistently outperforms other models, though proprietary models increasingly demonstrate comparable performance. Additionally, we find that supervised training specifically targeting pointing tasks significantly enhances model performance. Across our multi-stage evaluation pipeline, we also observe strong correlations, underscoring the critical role of precise pointing capabilities in enabling multimodal models to effectively bridge abstract reasoning with concrete, real-world actions.

| **[Beyond Time: Cross-Dimensional Frequency Supervision for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11567v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields, and the methods based on frequency domain analysis have become an important branch. However, most existing studies focus on the design of elaborate model architectures and are often tailored for limited datasets, still lacking universality. Besides, the assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) data also contradicts the strong correlation of the time domain labels. To address these issues, abandoning time domain supervision, we propose a purely frequency domain supervision approach named cross-dimensional frequency (X-Freq) loss. Specifically, based on a statistical phenomenon, we first prove that the information entropy of the time series is higher than its spectral entropy, which implies higher certainty in frequency domain and thus can provide better supervision. Secondly, the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform are applied to the time dimension and the channel dimension of the time series respectively, to capture the long-term and short-term frequency variations as well as the spatial configuration features. Thirdly, the loss between predictions and targets is uniformly computed in the frequency domain. Moreover, we plug-and-play incorporate X-Freq into multiple advanced forecasting models and compare on 14 real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, without making any modification to the original architectures or hyperparameters, X-Freq can improve the forecasting performance by an average of 3.3% on long-term forecasting datasets and 27.7% on short-term ones, showcasing superior generality and practicality. The code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a promising solution, its application in practice is hindered by high trial-and-error costs in real world and unsatisfactory physical network performance during training. Also, existing DRL-based user association methods are typically applicable to scenarios with a fixed number of users due to convergence and compatibility challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce a large vision model (LVM)-enhanced digital twin (DT) for wireless networks and propose a parallel DT-driven DRL method for user association and load balancing in networks with dynamic user counts, distribution, and mobility patterns. To construct this LVM-enhanced DT for DRL training, we develop a zero-shot generative user mobility model, named Map2Traj, based on the diffusion model. Map2Traj estimates user trajectory patterns and spatial distributions solely from street maps. DRL models undergo training in the DT environment, avoiding direct interactions with physical networks. To enhance the generalization ability of DRL models for dynamic scenarios, a parallel DT framework is further established to alleviate strong correlation and non-stationarity in single-environment training and improve training efficiency. Numerical results show that the developed LVM-enhanced DT achieves closely comparable training efficacy to the real environment, and the proposed parallel DT framework even outperforms the single real-world environment in DRL training with nearly 20\% gain in terms of cell-edge user performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.19765.

Numerous studies emphasize the significance of the quality of instruction tuning (IT) data, revealing a strong correlation between IT data quality and the alignment performance of LLMs. In these studies, the quality of IT data is typically assessed by evaluating the performance of LLMs trained with that data. However, we identified a prevalent issue in such practice: hyperparameters for training models are often selected arbitrarily without adequate justification. We observed significant variations in hyperparameters applied across different studies, even when training the same model with the same data. In this study, we demonstrate the potential problems arising from this practice and emphasize the need for careful consideration in verifying data quality. Through our experiments on the quality of LIMA data and a selected set of 1,000 Alpaca data points, we demonstrate that arbitrary hyperparameter decisions can make any arbitrary conclusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACL2025-main</p></details> |

We propose a new conformal prediction (CP)-based metric, termed the Conformal Prediction Confidence Factor (CPCF), to quantify and evaluate CF effectively. Our framework leverages adaptive CP to estimate forgetting by monitoring the model's confidence on previously learned tasks. This approach provides a dynamic and practical solution for monitoring and measuring CF of previous tasks as new ones are introduced, offering greater suitability for real-world applications. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate a strong correlation between CPCF and the accuracy of previous tasks, validating the reliability and interpretability of the proposed metric. Our results highlight the potential of CPCF as a robust and effective tool for assessing and understanding CF in dynamic learning environments.</p></details> |  |

However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency.

Following the learning to optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy calculations, and the lowest failure rate.</p></details> |  |

However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Traditional benchmarking, however, often struggles to account for system-specific variability, making it difficult to form actionable conclusions. We present a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that rigorously quantifies performance metrics and their uncertainty, enabling a nuanced comparison of algorithmic strategies. We apply this framework to analyze the Dimer method, comparing Conjugate Gradient (CG) and L-BFGS rotation optimizers, with and without the removal of external rotations, across a benchmark of 500 molecular systems. Our analysis confirms that CG offers higher overall robustness than L-BFGS in this context. While the theoretically-motivated removal of external rotations led to higher computational cost (>40% more energy and force calls) for most systems in this set, our models also reveal a subtle interplay, hinting that this feature may improve the reliability of the L-BFGS optimizer. Rather than identifying a single superior method, our findings support the design of adaptive "chain of methods" workflows. This work showcases how a robust statistical paradigm can move beyond simple performance rankings to inform the intelligent, context-dependent application of computational chemistry methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 30 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically constrained approach, suggesting that directly predicting the forces yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency -- and that energy conservation can be learned during training. This work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Contrary to the case of rotational symmetry, energy conservation is hard to learn, monitor, and correct for. The best approach to exploit the acceleration afforded by direct force prediction might be to use it in tandem with a conservative model, reducing -- rather than eliminating -- the additional cost of backpropagation, but avoiding the pathological behavior associated with non-conservative forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (including references) + appendix Conference format</p></details> |
| **[Adjoint Sampling: Highly Scalable Diffusion Samplers via Adjoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11713v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[The velocity jump Langevin process and its splitting scheme: long time convergence and numerical accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08846v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Langevin dynamics is a diffusion process extensively used, in particular in molecular dynamics simulations, to sample Gibbs measures. Some alternatives based on (piecewise deterministic) kinetic velocity jump processes have gained interest over the last decade. One interest of the latter is the possibility to split forces (at the continuous-time level), reducing the numerical cost for sampling the trajectory. Motivated by this, a numerical scheme based on hybrid dynamics combining velocity jumps and Langevin diffusion, numerically more efficient than their classical Langevin counterparts, has been introduced for computational chemistry in [42]. The present work is devoted to the numerical analysis of this scheme. Our main results are, first, the exponential ergodicity of the continuous-time velocity jump Langevin process, second, a Talay-Tubaro expansion of the invariant measure of the numerical scheme on the torus, showing in particular that the scheme is of weak order 2 in the step-size and, third, a bound on the quadratic risk of the corresponding practical MCMC estimator (possibly with Richardson extrapolation). With respect to previous works on the Langevin diffusion, new difficulties arise from the jump operator, which is non-local.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Scalable Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction through Adaptive Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01171v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian matrix prediction is pivotal in computational chemistry, serving as the foundation for determining a wide range of molecular properties. While SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their substantial computational cost--driven by high-order tensor product (TP) operations--restricts their scalability to large molecular systems with extensive basis sets. To address this challenge, we introduce SPHNet, an efficient and scalable equivariant network, that incorporates adaptive SParsity into Hamiltonian prediction. SPHNet employs two innovative sparse gates to selectively constrain non-critical interaction combinations, significantly reducing tensor product computations while maintaining accuracy. To optimize the sparse representation, we develop a Three-phase Sparsity Scheduler, ensuring stable convergence and achieving high performance at sparsity rates of up to 70%. Extensive evaluations on QH9 and PubchemQH datasets demonstrate that SPHNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing up to a 7x speedup over existing models. Beyond Hamiltonian prediction, the proposed sparsification techniques also hold significant potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of other SE(3) equivariant networks, further broadening their applicability and impact.

Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Moreover, we demonstrate improved robustness during MD simulations of the MLIP models trained with the proposed weakly supervised loss. Finally, our approach improves the fine-tuning of foundation models on sparse, highly accurate ab initio data. An implementation of our method and scripts for executing experiments are available at https://github.com/nec-research/PICPS-ML4Sci.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 4 figures, 31 Tables.

A Benchmark for Graph Pattern Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05298v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in graph-related tasks is becoming an increasingly popular and crucial area of research. Recent studies have shown that LLMs exhibit a preliminary ability to understand graph structures and node features. However, the potential of LLMs in graph pattern mining remains largely unexplored. This is a key component in fields such as computational chemistry, biology, and social network analysis. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs' capabilities in graph pattern tasks. We have developed a benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can understand graph patterns based on either terminological or topological descriptions. Additionally, our benchmark tests the LLMs' capacity to autonomously discover graph patterns from data. The benchmark encompasses both synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of models, with a total of 11 tasks and 7 models. Our experimental framework is designed for easy expansion to accommodate new models and datasets. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs have preliminary abilities to understand graph patterns, with O1-mini outperforming in the majority of tasks; (2) Formatting input data to align with the knowledge acquired during pretraining can enhance performance; (3) The strategies employed by LLMs may differ from those used in conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is published in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

In this regard, Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach in computational chemistry and materials science, combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods with computational efficiency orders of magnitude superior to ab-initio methods. This chapter provides an introduction of the fundamentals of learning and how it is applied to construct MLFFs, detailing key methodologies such as neural network potentials and kernel-based models. Emphasis is placed on the construction of SchNet model, as one of the most elemental neural network-based force fields that are nowadays the basis of modern architectures. Additionally, the GDML framework is described in detail as an example of how the elegant formulation of kernel methods can be used to construct mathematically robust and physics-inspired MLFFs. The ongoing advancements in MLFF development continue to expand their applicability, enabling precise simulations of large and complex systems that were previously beyond reach. This chapter concludes by highlighting the transformative impact of MLFFs on scientific research, underscoring their role in driving future discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics, and materials science.</p></details> | 9 figures |

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Auto-ADMET: An Effective and Interpretable AutoML Method for Chemical ADMET Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16378v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has been playing important roles in drug discovery in the past years by providing (pre-)screening tools for prioritising chemical compounds to pass through wet lab experiments. One of the main ML tasks in drug discovery is to build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an activity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound behaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods exist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's personalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since the chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact leads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by the model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to solve this issue, outputting tailored ML algorithms to the data at hand. Although an important task, AutoML has not been practically used to assist cheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few works related to the field. To address these challenges, this work introduces Auto-ADMET, an interpretable evolutionary-based AutoML method for chemical ADMET property prediction. Auto-ADMET employs a Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) method with a Bayesian Network Model to achieve comparable or better predictive performance against three alternative methods -- standard GGP method, pkCSM and XGBOOST model -- on 12 benchmark chemical ADMET property prediction datasets. The use of a Bayesian Network model on Auto-ADMET's evolutionary process assisted in both shaping the search procedure and interpreting the causes of its AutoML performance.</p></details> |  |

However, full KRR solvers are challenging to scale to large datasets: both direct (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (i.e., PCG) incur prohibitive computational and storage costs. The standard approach to scale KRR to large datasets chooses a set of inducing points and solves an approximate version of the problem, inducing points KRR. However, the resulting solution tends to have worse predictive performance than the full KRR solution. In this work, we introduce a new solver, ASkotch, for full KRR that provides better solutions faster than state-of-the-art solvers for full and inducing points KRR. ASkotch is a scalable, accelerated, iterative method for full KRR that provably obtains linear convergence. Under appropriate conditions, we show that ASkotch obtains condition-number-free linear convergence. This convergence analysis rests on the theory of ridge leverage scores and determinantal point processes. ASkotch outperforms state-of-the-art KRR solvers on a testbed of 23 large-scale KRR regression and classification tasks derived from a wide range of application domains, demonstrating the superiority of full KRR over inducing points KRR. Our work opens up the possibility of as-yet-unimagined applications of full KRR across a number of disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages (including appendices), 16 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Catalyst discovery is fundamental yet challenging in computational chemistry and has garnered significant attention due to the promising performance of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) notably accelerates progress in the discovery of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, where their chemical reactions differ significantly in material phases, temperature, dynamics, etc. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that discusses the progress and latest developments in both areas, particularly with the application of LLM techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a thorough and systematic survey of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, employing a unified and general categorization for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. We examine the progress of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, highlighting their individual advantages and disadvantages, and discuss the challenges faced in this field. Furthermore, we suggest potential directions for future research from the perspective of computer science. Our goal is to assist researchers in computational chemistry, computer science, and related fields in easily tracking the latest advancements, providing a clear overview and roadmap of this area. We also organize and make accessible relevant resources, including article lists and datasets, in an open repository at https://github.com/LuckyGirl-XU/Awesome-Artificial-Intelligence-Empowered-Catalyst-Discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |

Self-attention offers a compelling mechanism for capturing these global effects, but its quadratic complexity presents a significant practical limitation. This problem is particularly pronounced in computational chemistry, where the stringent efficiency requirements of machine learning force fields (MLFFs) often preclude accurately modeling long-range interactions. To address this, we introduce Euclidean fast attention (EFA), a linear-scaling attention-like mechanism designed for Euclidean data, which can be easily incorporated into existing model architectures. A core component of EFA are novel Euclidean rotary positional encodings (ERoPE), which enable efficient encoding of spatial information while respecting essential physical symmetries. We empirically demonstrate that EFA effectively captures diverse long-range effects, enabling EFA-equipped MLFFs to describe challenging chemical interactions for which conventional MLFFs yield incorrect results.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we design and discuss an algorithm that has similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which contains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets, which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51 dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to the graph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system. We then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional neural networks can be transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186 dimensional potential surface. We find that our algorithm does provide reasonably accurate results for this larger dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher dimensional potential surface problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Riemannian Denoising Score Matching for Molecular Structure Optimization with Accurate Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19769v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a modified score matching method aimed at generating molecular structures with high energy accuracy. The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pre-trained Molecular Language Models with Random Functional Group Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01401v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in computational chemistry have leveraged the power of trans-former-based language models, such as MoLFormer, pre-trained using a vast amount of simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) sequences, to understand and predict molecular properties and activities, a critical step in fields like drug discovery and materials science. To further improve performance, researchers have introduced graph neural networks with graph-based molecular representations, such as GEM, incorporating the topology, geometry, 2D or even 3D structures of molecules into pre-training. While most of molecular graphs in existing studies were automatically converted from SMILES sequences, it is to assume that transformer-based language models might be able to implicitly learn structure-aware representations from SMILES sequences. In this paper, we propose \ours{} -- a SMILES-based \underline{\em M}olecular \underline{\em L}anguage \underline{\em M}odel, which randomly masking SMILES subsequences corresponding to specific molecular \underline{\em F}unctional \underline{\em G}roups to incorporate structure information of atoms during the pre-training phase. This technique aims to compel the model to better infer molecular structures and properties, thus enhancing its predictive capabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations across 11 benchmark classification and regression tasks in the chemical domain demonstrate the robustness and superiority of \ours{}. Our findings reveal that \ours{} outperforms existing pre-training models, either based on SMILES or graphs, in 9 out of the 11 downstream tasks, ranking as a close second in the remaining ones.</p></details> | Under review |

Deep learning (DL) approaches have recently emerged as promising alternatives to computationally-heavy classical methods such as density functional theory (DFT). However, we discover that existing DL methods inadequately model inter-atomic forces, particularly for non-bonded atomic pairs, due to their naive usage of bonds and pairwise distances. Consequently, significant prediction errors occur for atoms with low degree (i.e., low coordination numbers) whose conformations are primarily influenced by non-bonded interactions. To address this, we propose REBIND, a novel framework that rewires molecular graphs by adding edges based on the Lennard-Jones potential to capture non-bonded interactions for low-degree atoms. Experimental results demonstrate that REBIND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various molecular sizes, achieving up to a 20\% reduction in prediction error.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Exposure Bias in Score-Based Generation of Molecular Conformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14014v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular conformation generation poses a significant challenge in the field of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9. We provide the code publicly at https://github.com/jia-975/torsionalDiff-ip.</p></details> | SMC 2024 |

| **[Generative artificial intelligence for computational chemistry: a roadmap to predicting emergent phenomena](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03118v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced exciting possibilities for computational chemistry. Generative AI methods have made significant progress in sampling molecular structures across chemical species, developing force fields, and speeding up simulations. This Perspective offers a structured overview, beginning with the fundamental theoretical concepts in both Generative AI and computational chemistry. It then covers widely used Generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before, and that Generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry. We suggest that to overcome these challenges, future AI models need to integrate core chemical principles, especially from statistical mechanics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Maize: Cyclic and conditional computational graphs for molecular simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10064v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many computational chemistry and molecular simulation workflows can be expressed as graphs. This abstraction is useful to modularize and potentially reuse existing components, as well as provide parallelization and ease reproducibility. Existing tools represent the computation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), thus allowing efficient execution by parallelization of concurrent branches. These systems can, however, generally not express cyclic and conditional workflows. We therefore developed Maize, a workflow manager for cyclic and conditional graphs based on the principles of flow-based programming. By running each node of the graph concurrently in separate processes and allowing communication at any time through dedicated inter-node channels, arbitrary graph structures can be executed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool on a dynamic active learning task in computational drug design, involving the use of a small molecule generative model and an associated scoring system, and on a reactivity prediction pipeline using quantum-chemistry and semiempirical approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Organization in Computation & Chemistry: Return to AlChemy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12137v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do complex adaptive systems, such as life, emerge from simple constituent parts? In the 1990s Walter Fontana and Leo Buss proposed a novel modeling approach to this question, based on a formal model of computation known as $\lambda$ calculus. The model demonstrated how simple rules, embedded in a combinatorially large space of possibilities, could yield complex, dynamically stable organizations, reminiscent of biochemical reaction networks. Here, we revisit this classic model, called AlChemy, which has been understudied over the past thirty years. We reproduce the original results and study the robustness of those results using the greater computing resources available today. Our analysis reveals several unanticipated features of the system, demonstrating a surprising mix of dynamical robustness and fragility. Specifically, we find that complex, stable organizations emerge more frequently than previously expected, that these organizations are robust against collapse into trivial fixed-points, but that these stable organizations cannot be easily combined into higher order entities. We also study the role played by the random generators used in the model, characterizing the initial distribution of objects produced by two random expression generators, and their consequences on the results. Finally, we provide a constructive proof that shows how an extension of the model, based on typed $\lambda$ calculus, could simulate transitions between arbitrary states in any possible chemical reaction network, thus indicating a concrete connection between AlChemy and chemical reaction networks. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of AlChemy to self-organization in modern programming languages and quantitative approaches to the origin of life.</p></details> |  |

General sparse tensor algebra compilers are not always versatile enough to generate asymptotically optimal code for sparse tensor contractions. This paper shows how to generate asymptotically better schedules for complex sparse tensor expressions using kernel fission and fusion. We present generalized loop restructuring transformations to reduce asymptotic time complexity and memory footprint. Furthermore, we present an auto-scheduler that uses a partially ordered set (poset)-based cost model that uses both time and auxiliary memory complexities to prune the search space of schedules. In addition, we highlight the use of Satisfiability Module Theory (SMT) solvers in sparse auto-schedulers to approximate the Pareto frontier of better schedules to the smallest number of possible schedules, with user-defined constraints available at compile-time. Finally, we show that our auto-scheduler can select better-performing schedules and generate code for them. Our results show that the auto-scheduler provided schedules achieve orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to the code generated by the Tensor Algebra Compiler (TACO) for several computations on different real-world tensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-Based Molecular Graph Generation with Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09896v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in computational chemistry have increasingly focused on synthesizing molecules based on textual instructions. Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus. Our code is availble at https://github.com/ran1812/UTGDiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hessian QM9: A quantum chemistry database of molecular Hessians in implicit solvents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08006v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant challenge in computational chemistry is developing approximations that accelerate \emph{ab initio} methods while preserving accuracy. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a promising solution for constructing atomistic potentials that can be transferred across different molecular and crystalline systems. Most MLIPs are trained only on energies and forces in vacuum, while an improved description of the potential energy surface could be achieved by including the curvature of the potential energy surface. We present Hessian QM9, the first database of equilibrium configurations and numerical Hessian matrices, consisting of 41,645 molecules from the QM9 dataset at the $\omega$B97x/6-31G* level. Molecular Hessians were calculated in vacuum, as well as water, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene using an implicit solvation model. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we show that incorporating second derivatives of the potential energy surface into the loss function of a MLIP significantly improves the prediction of vibrational frequencies in all solvent environments, thus making this dataset extremely useful for studying organic molecules in realistic solvent environments for experimental characterization.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figues |
| **[StringNET: Neural Network based Variational Method for Transition Pathways](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12621v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare transition events in meta-stable systems under noisy fluctuations are crucial for many non-equilibrium physical and chemical processes. In these processes, the primary contributions to reactive flux are predominantly near the transition pathways that connect two meta-stable states. Efficient computation of these paths is essential in computational chemistry. In this work, we examine the temperature-dependent maximum flux path, the minimum energy path, and the minimum action path at zero temperature. We propose the StringNET method for training these paths using variational formulations and deep learning techniques. Unlike traditional chain-of-state methods, StringNET directly parametrizes the paths through neural network functions, utilizing the arc-length parameter as the main input. The tasks of gradient descent and re-parametrization in the string method are unified into a single framework using loss functions to train deep neural networks. More importantly, the loss function for the maximum flux path is interpreted as a softmax approximation to the numerically challenging minimax problem of the minimum energy path. To compute the minimum energy path efficiently and robustly, we developed a pre-training strategy that includes the maximum flux path loss in the early training stage, significantly accelerating the computation of minimum energy and action paths. We demonstrate the superior performance of this method through various analytical and chemical examples, as well as the two- and four-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau functional energy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion with time step prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10935v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field (FF) methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network FF models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface (PES) instead of the complex physical PES. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical FFs, equivariant neural network FFs trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their energies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Non-Nested Configurations of Multifidelity Machine Learning for Quantum-Chemical Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17087v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multifidelity machine learning (MFML) for quantum chemical (QC) properties has seen strong development in the recent years. The method has been shown to reduce the cost of generating training data for high-accuracy low-cost ML models. In such a set-up, the ML models are trained on molecular geometries and some property of interest computed at various computational chemistry accuracies, or fidelities. These are then combined in training the MFML models. In some multifidelity models, the training data is required to be nested, that is the same molecular geometries are included to calculate the property across all the fidelities. In these multifidelity models, the requirement of a nested configuration restricts the kind of sampling that can be performed while selection training samples at different fidelities. This work assesses the use of non-nested training data for two of these multifidelity methods, namely MFML and optimized MFML (o-MFML). The assessment is carried out for the prediction of ground state energies and first vertical excitation energies of a diverse collection of molecules of the CheMFi dataset. Results indicate that the MFML method still requires a nested structure of training data across the fidelities. However, the o-MFML method shows promising results for non-nested multifidelity training data with model errors comparable to the nested configurations.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, these models can generate 3D molecular structures with specific properties or requirements crucial to drug discovery. Diffusion models were particularly successful at learning 3D molecular geometries' complex probability distributions and their corresponding chemical and physical properties through forward and reverse diffusion processes. This review focuses on the technical implementation of diffusion models tailored for 3D molecular generation. It compares the performance, evaluation methods, and implementation details of various diffusion models used for molecular generation tasks. We cover strategies for atom and bond representation, architectures of reverse diffusion denoising networks, and challenges associated with generating stable 3D molecular structures. This review also explores the applications of diffusion models in $\textit{de novo}$ drug design and related areas of computational chemistry, such as structure-based drug design, including target-specific molecular generation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics of protein-ligand complexes. We also cover conditional generation on physical properties, conformation generation, and fragment-based drug design. By summarizing the state-of-the-art diffusion models for 3D molecular generation, this review sheds light on their role in advancing drug discovery as well as their current limitations.</p></details> |  |

Hypergraphs are not merely an extension of traditional graphs; they are pivotal for modeling high-order relationships, a capability that conventional equivariant graph-based methods lack due to their inherent limitations in representing intricate many-body interactions. To achieve this, we first construct hypergraphs via proposing a new fragmentation method that considers both chemical and three-dimensional spatial information of molecular system. We then design SE3Set, which incorporates equivariance into the hypergragh neural network. This ensures that the learned molecular representations are invariant to spatial transformations, thereby providing robustness essential for accurate prediction of molecular properties. SE3Set has shown performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for small molecule datasets like QM9 and MD17. It excels on the MD22 dataset, achieving a notable improvement of approximately 20% in accuracy across all molecules, which highlights the prevalence of complex many-body interactions in larger molecules. This exceptional performance of SE3Set across diverse molecular structures underscores its transformative potential in computational chemistry, offering a route to more accurate and physically nuanced modeling.</p></details> |  |

The model relies on a nonlinear equation defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a space-dependent dielectric permittivity and an ion-exclusion function that accounts for steric effects. Potential theory arguments transform the nonlinear equation into two coupled equations defined in a bounded domain. Then, the Schwarz decomposition method is used to formulate local problems by decomposing the cavity into overlapping balls and only solving a set of coupled sub-equations in each ball. The main novelty of the proposed method is the introduction of a hybrid linear-nonlinear solver used to solve the equation. A series of numerical experiments are presented to test the method and show the importance of the nonlinear model.</p></details> |  |

One of the most popular datasets as a bencharmk to develop NFFs models is the MD17 dataset and its subsequent extension. These datasets comprise geometries from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy surface, sampled from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical reactions involve significant molecular geometrical deformations, for example, bond breaking. Therefore, MD17 is inadequate to represent a chemical reaction. To address this limitation in MD17, we introduce a new dataset, called Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics (xxMD) dataset. The xxMD dataset involves geometries sampled from direct non-adiabatic dynamics, and the energies are computed at both multireference wavefunction theory and density functional theory. We show that the xxMD dataset involves diverse geometries which represent chemical reactions. Assessment of NFF models on xxMD dataset reveals significantly higher predictive errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This work underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF model with extrapolation capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, many figures.

In order to fully exploit modern multi-core parallel computers, it is necessary to develop decoupling algorithms for computing the best rank-one approximation of higher-order tensors at large scales. In this paper, we first build a bridge between the rank-one approximation of tensors and the eigenvector-dependent nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEPv), and then develop an efficient decoupling algorithm, namely the higher-order self-consistent field (HOSCF) algorithm, inspired by the famous self-consistent field (SCF) iteration frequently used in computational chemistry. The convergence theory of the HOSCF algorithm and an estimation of the convergence speed are further presented. In addition, we propose an improved HOSCF (iHOSCF) algorithm that incorporates the Rayleigh quotient iteration, which can significantly accelerate the convergence of HOSCF. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently converge to the best rank-one approximation of both synthetic and real-world tensors and can scale with high parallel scalability on a modern parallel computer.</p></details> |  |
